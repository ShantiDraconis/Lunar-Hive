# Financial Strategy

## Overview

This directory contains strategic financial planning and resource allocation documents for the Lunar-Hive project's digital infrastructure expansion.

## Purpose

The financial strategy documents serve to:
- **Optimize Capital Allocation**: Ensure seed capital is deployed for maximum ROI
- **Enable Sustainable Scaling**: Transform initial resources into self-sustaining revenue streams
- **Guide Decision-Making**: Provide clear triggers and metrics for expansion decisions
- **Document Execution**: Track progress against strategic milestones

## Core Principles

1. **Seed Capital as Engine**: Capital is not spent, but invested to create sustainable revenue
2. **Digital-First**: Prioritize digital infrastructure before physical asset acquisition
3. **Metrics-Driven**: All decisions based on measurable performance indicators
4. **ROI Minimums**: Every investment must meet minimum ROI thresholds
5. **Cash Flow Over Balance**: Expansion triggered by consistent cash flow, not one-time balance

## Documents

- `/03_CONTENT_CORE/concepts/architect_sovereignty_log.md` - Sovereignty framework
- `/00_CORE_MANIFESTO/manifesto_soberania.md` - Core principles

### Sustainability Alignment
Financial strategy aligns with `/docs/axes/SUSTAINABILITY.md` principles:
- Resource accounting (capital as finite resource)
- Closed-loop thinking (revenue reinvestment)
- Human rights integration (sovereignty and autonomy)
- System resilience (emergency reserves, sustainable growth)

## Investment Breakdown

| Category | Allocation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Infrastructure | £1,200-£1,500 | Content production hardware |
| Marketing/Conversion | £500-£800 | Amazon book promotion campaigns |
| Emergency Reserve | £1,700+ | Operational security during scaling |

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Monthly Revenue**: Target $12,000 by March 2026
- **Marketing ROI**: Minimum 300% (3:1 ratio)
- **Reserve Status**: £1,700+ maintained
- **Growth Rate**: 30-50% month-over-month during scaling phase

### Platform-Specific Metrics
- **Amazon**: Royalties, units sold, KENP pages, category rankings
- **Google/YouTube**: CTR, cost per conversion, organic traffic, engagement
- **Apple**: Production quality, output consistency, perceived authority

## Decision Triggers

### Green (Proceed)
- ✅ Revenue ≥ $12,000 for 2+ consecutive months
- ✅ Marketing ROI ≥ 300%
- ✅ Emergency reserve intact
- ✅ Positive, growing cash flow

### Yellow (Caution)
- ⚠️ Revenue $8,000-$11,999
- ⚠️ Marketing ROI 200-299%
- ⚠️ Reserve partially depleted

### Red (Reassess)
- 🛑 Revenue < $8,000
- 🛑 Marketing ROI < 200%
- 🛑 Reserve critically low
