# Moderation

## Purpose

The Lunar Hive is a **curated public archive**. Moderation exists to maintain quality, safety, and focus.

This document explains **how moderation works** and **what happens when standards aren't met**.

---

## Moderation Philosophy

### Principles
1. **Clarity over politeness**: Direct communication is preferred
2. **Assume good faith**: First violations get explanation, not punishment
3. **Enforce consistently**: Same rules for everyone
4. **Focus on behavior**: Not identity or affiliation
5. **Transparent actions**: Decisions are public (except for sensitive issues)

### What Moderation Is Not
- Not censorship of ideas (disagreement is welcome)
- Not punishment for asking questions
- Not protection from criticism
- Not consensus-building (see `GOVERNANCE.md`)

---

## What Gets Moderated

### Content Quality (Discussions, Issues, PRs)

**Violations**:
- Unsupported claims stated as fact
- Off-topic content
- Duplicate issues or discussions
- Low-effort posts ("What do you think about everything?")
- Promotional content or spam

**Action**:
1. First time: Comment explaining standard, request edit
2. If not fixed: Close with explanation
3. If repeated: Temporary restriction

---

### Behavior Standards (All Channels)

**Minor Violations**:
- Unnecessarily hostile tone
- Personal comments instead of idea focus
- Excessive posting (flooding)
- Ignoring previous answers

**Action**:
1. Warning with explanation
2. If continued: Temporary interaction limit
3. If persistent: Longer restriction

**Major Violations**:
- Personal attacks or harassment
- Threats or intimidation
- Deliberate misinformation
- Doxxing or privacy violation
- Spam or commercial promotion
- Sockpuppeting or ban evasion

**Action**:
1. Immediate removal of content
2. Temporary or permanent ban depending on severity
3. Report to GitHub if necessary

## Moderation Process

### For Content Issues

**Step 1: Identify**
- Moderator or community member flags issue
- Review against documented standards

**Step 2: Communicate**
- Comment on issue/discussion/PR explaining problem
- Reference relevant policy document
- Give clear path to resolution

**Step 3: Wait**
- Allow reasonable time for response (24-72 hours typical)
- Consider time zones and availability

**Step 4: Resolve**
- If fixed: Thank contributor, move forward
- If not fixed: Close/lock with explanation
- If argued badly: Explain once more, then close

**Step 5: Document**
- Pattern of issues noted internally
- Persistent problems lead to restrictions

---

### For Behavior Issues

**Step 1: Assess Severity**
- Minor: Single instance, possibly accidental
- Moderate: Clear violation but not malicious
- Severe: Harassment, threats, or repeated violations

**Step 2: Act**
- **Minor**: Public comment with warning
- **Moderate**: Remove content + temporary restriction
- **Severe**: Immediate ban + report if needed

**Step 3: Communicate**
- Explain violation clearly
- Reference code of conduct
- State consequence and duration

**Step 4: Log**
- Keep record of moderation actions
- Track patterns for repeat offenders

## Specific Scenarios

### Spam or Promotion
**Action**: Immediate removal + ban  
**Reason**: Zero tolerance, obvious bad faith

### "I think you're wrong"
**Action**: None (this is allowed)  
**Reason**: Disagreement is not violation

### "You're an idiot"
**Action**: Warning first time, restriction if repeated  
**Reason**: Personal attack, not idea critique

### Posting 20 issues at once
**Action**: Close all but most important, explain in first  
**Reason**: Overwhelming maintainers, low-quality mass posting

### "Can someone explain everything?"
**Action**: Close with link to `START_HERE.md`  
**Reason**: Low-effort, should read docs first

### "This is all wrong" (no specifics)
**Action**: Request specific claims with evidence  
**Reason**: Vague criticism is not actionable

### Long, rambling post
**Action**: Request summary or bullet points  
**Reason**: Violates conciseness guideline

### Off-topic discussion
**Action**: Redirect to appropriate place or close  
**Reason**: Maintains focus

### Good question in wrong place
**Action**: Move or redirect kindly  
**Reason**: Help contributor succeed

### Repeated arguing after decision
**Action**: Lock thread, explain finality  
**Reason**: Endless debate wastes everyone's time

## Appeal Process

### If You Think Moderation Was Wrong

**Step 1**: Read the relevant policy documents
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Relevant docs in `/docs/policies/`

**Step 2**: Check if you actually violated standards
- Be honest with yourself
- Consider that disagreement ≠ bad moderation

**Step 3**: If you genuinely believe error was made
- Open **new issue** labeled "moderation review"
- Explain calmly why you think decision was wrong
- Provide evidence of misapplication of standards
- Suggest what correct action should have been

**Step 4**: Accept decision
- Maintainers will review once
- Decision may stand or be reversed
- Further argument will be ignored

## Moderator Accountability

### Moderators Must
- Follow their own rules
- Explain decisions (when feasible)
- Admit mistakes if wrong
- Apply standards consistently
- Act on patterns, not single incidents

### Moderators Should Not
- Moderate based on personal preference
- Argue endlessly
- Retaliate for criticism
- Silence dissent
- Abuse authority

### If Moderator Misbehaves
- Document specific instances
- Report in issue labeled "conduct"
- Community feedback considered
- Serious violations addressed

But remember: **Decisions you don't like ≠ moderator misbehavior**

---

## Transparency

### Public Record
All moderation actions are visible except:
- Security issues
- Privacy violations
- Legal matters

You can see:
- Closed issues and why
- Locked discussions and why
- Removed comments (marked as removed)
- Banned users (GitHub shows this)

### Moderation Log
Significant actions documented in:
- Issue/PR comments
- Discussion threads
- GOVERNANCE.md updates if patterns emerge

---

## Special Cases

### Security Issues
- Not moderated by normal process
- See `SECURITY.md` for reporting
- Handled privately until resolved

### Legal Issues
- Immediate removal if necessary
- Reported to GitHub
- May involve legal consultation

### Unclear Cases
- Discussed among moderators
- Err on side of leniency for first-time issues
- Documented for future consistency

---

## Evolution

This moderation policy will evolve as:
- New patterns emerge
- Community grows
- Problems are discovered
- Better approaches are found

Changes will be documented and announced.

---

## Current Moderators

See repository settings or `GOVERNANCE.md` for current maintainer list.

---

## Key Principle

**Moderation serves the archive, not the moderators.**

Its purpose is to maintain quality and safety so the Lunar Hive can fulfill its mission.

If moderation becomes about power or control rather than quality, it has failed.

## Questions?

If this policy doesn't cover your situation, ask in discussions or open a moderation review issue.
