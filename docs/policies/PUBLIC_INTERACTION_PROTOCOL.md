# Public Interaction Protocol

## Purpose

This protocol defines how the public interacts with the Lunar Hive and how
maintainers respond.

This is **not about control**. This is about **channeling energy productively**.

---

## Interaction Channels

### 1. Reading (No Barriers)

**Access**: Completely open  
**Requirements**: None  
**Expectations**: None  

You can read, save, reference, and link to any content without permission.

---

### 2. Discussions (Open Forum)

**Access**: GitHub account required  
**Purpose**: Questions, ideas, interpretations, signals  
**Moderation**: Active but light  

**Guidelines**:

- Keep messages concise (under 500 words preferred)
- Focus on ideas, not personalities
- Provide context for claims
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Respond to challenges respectfully

**What Happens**:

- Good questions get thoughtful responses
- Interesting ideas may be developed into content
- Off-topic posts are redirected or closed
- Hostile behavior results in removal

See: `DISCUSSIONS_GUIDE.md`

---

### 3. Issues (Structured Feedback)

**Access**: GitHub account required  
**Purpose**: Bug reports, proposals, research questions  
**Moderation**: Enforced through templates  

**Types**:

- **Bug Report**: Errors, broken links, formatting issues
- **Proposal**: Suggestions for new content or structure
- **Research**: Questions about specific topics

**What Happens**:

- Valid bugs get fixed quickly
- Good proposals get discussed and possibly implemented
- Research questions may become discussions or content
- Low-quality issues get closed with explanation

---

### 4. Pull Requests (Direct Changes)

**Access**: GitHub account + fork repository  
**Purpose**: Corrections, small improvements, typo fixes  
**Moderation**: Full review required  

**Acceptable PRs**:

- Fixing typos or formatting errors
- Correcting factual mistakes (with evidence)
- Adding missing citations
- Improving clarity without changing meaning

**Unacceptable PRs**:

- Major content additions (use proposals instead)
- Opinion changes without evidence
- Style changes for personal preference
- Anything outside documented scope

**What Happens**:

- Small, clear fixes get merged quickly
- Larger changes get discussed or converted to proposals
- Poor-quality PRs get closed with feedback

See: `.github/pull_request_template.md`

---

## Response Times

This is not a commercial service. Maintainers respond when able.

**Typical timeline**:

- Simple bugs: Days
- Discussions: Days to weeks
- Proposals: Weeks to months
- Research questions: Variable

**No response does not mean**:

- Your input is worthless
- The project is dead
- You should spam or escalate

**It may mean**:

- We're thinking about it
- It's low priority
- We disagree but don't want to argue
- We're working on something else

---

## What Gets Prioritized

### High Priority

- Security issues
- Factual errors with clear evidence
- Broken functionality (links, formatting)
- Well-reasoned proposals aligned with scope

### Medium Priority

- Interesting research questions
- Quality discussions
- Minor improvements
- Community contributions

### Low Priority

- Style debates
- Personal preferences
- Vague suggestions
- Requests outside scope

### No Priority (Ignored)

- Spam or advertising
- Demands for immediate response
- Hostile or manipulative behavior
- Attempts to change governance

---

## Maintainer Behavior

### What Maintainers Will Do

- Respond to good-faith interaction
- Explain decisions when feasible
- Acknowledge valuable contributions
- Enforce standards consistently
- Admit mistakes when made

### What Maintainers Won't Do

- Argue endlessly
- Justify every decision in detail
- Accommodate every preference
- Change scope for popularity
- Accept low-quality work to be "nice"

---

## Conflict Resolution

### If You Disagree With a Decision

1. Read the reasoning provided (if any)
2. Check if it aligns with documented principles and scope
3. If you still disagree, explain why **once** with evidence
4. Accept the final decision or fork the project

### If You Feel Mistreated

1. Review `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
2. Check if interaction violated stated standards
3. If yes, report through appropriate channel
4. If no, consider that disagreement ≠ mistreatment

### If Maintainers Behave Badly

- Document the behavior clearly
- Report in a conduct issue (labeled "conduct")
- Community feedback will be considered
- Egregious violations will be addressed

But remember: **Curated governance means decisions you don't like are not
automatically bad governance.**

---

## Transparency

All decisions are made publicly except:

- Security-related issues
- Personal conduct violations
- Legal matters

You can always see:

- What was accepted and why
- What was rejected and why (when explained)
- How standards are applied
- What's coming next (see `ROADMAP.md`)

---

## Evolution

This protocol may change as:

- The project matures
- Patterns emerge
- Problems arise
- Community grows

Changes will be documented and explained.

---

## Key Principle

**The Lunar Hive is not a democracy, but it is accountable.**

Maintainers have authority, but they must:

- Follow their own rules
- Explain their reasoning
- Maintain consistency
- Serve the project's purpose

If they fail, the archive itself will show it.

---

## Questions?

If this protocol doesn't cover your situation, ask in discussions.
