# Roadmap

## Purpose of This Document

The Lunar Hive **is not a startup with aggressive timelines**. It is an archive
designed to last decades.

This roadmap describes **direction, not promises**.

---

## Current State (2025)

### What Exists

✅ Core governance documents (LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, GOVERNANCE, SECURITY)  
✅ 00_MANIFEST (principles, scope, definitions, epistemology)  
✅ docs/ structure (navigation guides, policies, axes)  
✅ 03_CONTENT_CORE/ directories (awaiting content expansion)  
✅ .github/ templates and workflows  
✅ Initial content in concepts/  

### What Is Functional

✅ Repository structure is stable  
✅ Navigation is clear  
✅ Contribution pathways exist  
✅ Governance is explicit  

---

## Near-Term Development

### Content Expansion (Ongoing)

- **Mathematics**: Expand millennium problems and 0/0 analysis
- **Harappan**: Document symbol inventory and hypotheses
- **Engineering**: Develop system architecture frameworks
- **Sustainability**: Build closed-loop models
- **Olympics**: Analyze ritual and cohesion mechanisms

### Quality Improvements

- Markdown linting automation
- Link checking automation
- Citation format standardization
- Cross-reference system between axes

---

## Medium-Term Goals

### Integration Work

- Connect mathematical limits to resource constraints
- Link symbolic systems to engineering frameworks
- Demonstrate cross-axis coherence

### Community Building

- Establish discussion norms through moderation
- Curate high-quality contributions
- Build recognition for rigor

### Documentation Depth

- Increase falsifiability of hypotheses
- Add more references and citations
- Create worked examples and case studies

---

## Long-Term Vision

### Academic Recognition

- Become a cited reference in relevant fields
- Earn respect from serious researchers
- Maintain credibility through quality

### Archival Durability

- Remain accessible for decades
- Survive platform changes
- Preserve historical coherence

### Cultural Significance

- Serve as example of public rigor
- Demonstrate feasibility of curated openness
- Show that integration is possible

---

## What Will NOT Happen

❌ Commercial products or services  
❌ Paid courses or certifications  
❌ Dilution of standards for growth  
❌ Shift to entertainment or engagement metrics  
❌ Abandonment of curation for democracy  

The Lunar Hive will never compromise its nature to scale faster.

## Milestones (No Deadlines)

### Milestone 1: Foundation Complete

- All 00_MANIFEST files stable
- All docs/ guides written
- All 03_CONTENT_CORE/ directories with READMEs
- All .github/ templates functional

**Status**: In progress (2025)

### Milestone 2: Content Sufficient

- Each axis has substantial initial content
- Cross-references established
- Evidence standards met throughout
- Community contributions integrated

**Status**: Future

### Milestone 3: Recognition Established

- External citations in academic work
- Respected by subject matter experts
- Known for quality and rigor
- Stable community of serious contributors

**Status**: Long-term

## How You Can Help

### Now

- Read carefully
- Ask rigorous questions
- Point out errors or gaps
- Contribute small, focused improvements

### Soon

- Propose research directions
- Submit well-documented hypotheses
- Help refine evidence standards
- Participate in moderation

### Later

- Build on this foundation for your own work
- Cite and reference appropriately
- Extend ideas with proper attribution
- Maintain the culture of rigor

---

## Adaptation

This roadmap will be updated as:

- Priorities become clearer
- New opportunities emerge
- Community needs evolve
- External context changes

Updates will be documented and explained.

---

## Non-Negotiables

No matter how this project evolves:

- **Rigor remains essential**
- **Curation remains active**
- **Integration remains central**
- **Archive nature remains primary**

These are not flexible.

---

## Questions?

If you want to propose a specific direction or milestone, open a discussion
with:

- Clear description
- Alignment with scope and principles
- Concrete next steps
- Expected outcomes

Proposals are welcome. Demands are not.

---

**The Lunar Hive is patient. Quality takes time.**
