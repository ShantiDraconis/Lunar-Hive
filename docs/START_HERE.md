# Start Here

## Welcome to the Lunar Hive

If you are new to this archive, **start with this guide**. It will orient you
to the structure, purpose, and navigation of the repository.

---

## What Is This?

The **Lunar Hive** is the canonical public archive of the **Ecletic S system**.

It is:

- A **research repository** for rigorous inquiry
- A **documentation archive** for long-term reference
- A **conceptual foundation** connecting mathematics, language, engineering,
  sustainability, and culture

It is **not**:

- A course or tutorial
- A social platform
- A commercial product
- A complete theory (it is developing)

---

## First Steps

### 1. Read the Manifest (5 minutes)

Start in **`00_MANIFEST/`**:

- `README.md` — What this system is
- `PRINCIPLES.md` — Guiding principles
- `SCOPE.md` — What's included and excluded
- `DEFINITIONS.md` — Key terms
- `EPISTEMOLOGY.md` — How knowledge works here

**Why**: This gives you the conceptual foundation everything else builds on.

---

### 2. Understand the Structure (2 minutes)

Read **`TAXONOMY.md`** (this directory) to see how everything is organized.

**Why**: Prevents getting lost or misunderstanding relationships.

---

### 3. Choose Your Entry Point

Depending on your interest:

#### Mathematics & Logic

→ `docs/axes/MILLENNIUM_PROBLEMS.md`  
→ `docs/axes/ZERO_OVER_ZERO.md`  
→ `03_CONTENT_CORE/millennium/`  
→ `03_CONTENT_CORE/zero_over_zero/`

#### Language & Symbolism

→ `docs/axes/HARAPPAN.md`  
→ `03_CONTENT_CORE/harappan/`

#### Engineering & Systems

→ `docs/axes/ENGINEERING.md`  
→ `03_CONTENT_CORE/engineering/`

#### Sustainability

→ `docs/axes/SUSTAINABILITY.md`  
→ `03_CONTENT_CORE/sustainability/`

#### Cultural Systems

→ `docs/axes/OLYMPICS.md`  
→ `03_CONTENT_CORE/olympics/`

---

### 4. Explore Content

Navigate to **`03_CONTENT_CORE/`** and dive into specific topics.

Each major directory has a `README.md` explaining its contents.

---

- No account needed
- Link and reference freely

### Discussing

- Use GitHub Discussions for questions and ideas
- Follow the guidelines in `DISCUSSIONS_GUIDE.md`
- Focus on concepts, not personalities

### Contributing

- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` first
- Small corrections welcome via pull requests
- Major proposals via issues or discussions
- All contributions are curated

### Reporting Issues

- Use issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Be concise and clear
- Provide evidence when making claims

---

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Silence is intentional** — Not everything is explained immediately
2. **Limits are not errors** — Boundaries reveal structure
3. **Clarity over speed** — Rigor matters more than volume
4. **Evidence over authority** — Claims must stand on their own
5. **Integration over isolation** — Ideas are connected

(Full principles in `00_MANIFEST/PRINCIPLES.md`)

- **Evolving**: Growing, but not changing arbitrarily

### This Archive Is Not

- **Complete**: It's under development
- **Easy**: Some content requires effort
- **Casual**: This is serious work
- **Consensus-based**: Quality over popularity
