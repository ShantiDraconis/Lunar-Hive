# Millennium Problems Axis

## Overview

The **Millennium Prize Problems** are seven mathematical challenges identified by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, each with a $1 million prize for solution.

The Lunar Hive does not claim to solve these. Instead, we **observe them as boundary phenomena** — places where mathematical frameworks reveal their structure through difficulty.

## Why This Matters to Ecletic S

These problems are not just puzzles. They are **signals**:
- They mark limits of current mathematical methods
- They reveal where frameworks need extension
- They show connections between seemingly separate domains
- They demonstrate how rigor operates at the edge

Our interest: **What do unsolved problems tell us about the nature of systems?**

## The Seven Problems

### 1. Riemann Hypothesis
**Status**: Unsolved  
**Domain**: Number theory, complex analysis  
**Prize**: $1M (unclaimed)

**Statement**: All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real part ½.

**Ecletic S Perspective**:
- Connects prime distribution to complex analysis
- Boundary behavior of zeta function
- What does "almost everywhere true" mean at limits?

**Content**: See `/03_CONTENT_CORE/millennium/riemann/`

---

### 2. P vs NP
**Status**: Unsolved  
**Domain**: Computational complexity theory  
**Prize**: $1M (unclaimed)

**Statement**: If a solution to a problem can be verified quickly, can it also be found quickly?

**Ecletic S Perspective**:
- Fundamental limit of computation
- Verification vs. discovery distinction
- Collapse between proof and search

**Content**: See `/03_CONTENT_CORE/millennium/p_vs_np/`

---

### 3. Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness
**Status**: Unsolved  
**Domain**: Partial differential equations, fluid dynamics  
**Prize**: $1M (unclaimed)

**Statement**: Do solutions to Navier-Stokes equations in 3D always exist and remain smooth?

**Ecletic S Perspective**:
- Collapse phenomena in continuous systems
- When do mathematical models break down physically?
- Smoothness as boundary condition

**Content**: See `/03_CONTENT_CORE/millennium/navier_stokes/`

---

### 4. Yang-Mills and Mass Gap
**Status**: Unsolved  
**Domain**: Quantum field theory  
**Prize**: $1M (unclaimed)

**Statement**: Prove quantum Yang-Mills theory exists mathematically and has a mass gap.

**Ecletic S Perspective**:
- Physics meets mathematical rigor
- What does it mean for a theory to "exist" mathematically?
- Bridging physical and formal systems

---

### 5. Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
**Status**: Unsolved  
**Domain**: Number theory, algebraic geometry  
**Prize**: $1M (unclaimed)

**Statement**: Relates the number of rational points on elliptic curves to their L-functions.

**Ecletic S Perspective**:
- Deep structure of rational solutions
- Connection between geometry and arithmetic
- How discrete and continuous interact

---

### 6. Hodge Conjecture
**Status**: Unsolved  
**Domain**: Algebraic geometry  
**Prize**: $1M (unclaimed)

**Statement**: Certain cohomology classes are algebraic (can be represented by combinations of algebraic cycles).

**Ecletic S Perspective**:
- What shapes are "natural" in mathematics?
- Topology meets algebra
- Boundaries of representability

---

### 7. Poincaré Conjecture
**Status**: **SOLVED** (Grigori Perelman, 2003)  
**Domain**: Topology  
**Prize**: $1M (declined)

**Statement**: Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.

**Ecletic S Perspective**:
- How shape and connectivity interact in 3D
- What does "decline the prize" signal about mathematical culture?
- Solved example shows others are solvable (in principle)

## Connections to Other Axes

### To Zero Over Zero
- Riemann Hypothesis involves behavior at limits
- Navier-Stokes examines continuous collapse
- All involve boundary behavior where frameworks stretch

### To Engineering
- P vs NP has direct implications for algorithm design
- Navier-Stokes governs fluid dynamics in real systems
- Yang-Mills underlies particle physics engineering

### To Epistemology
- What counts as a valid proof?
- How do we know when a problem is "really" solved?
- Perelman's rejection raises questions about authority

## Our Approach

### What We Do
✓ Observe structural patterns across problems  
✓ Note connections to limits and collapse  
✓ Document approaches and their boundaries  
✓ Learn from failure modes  

### What We Don't Do
✗ Claim to solve these problems  
✗ Propose solutions without rigorous proof  
✗ Speculate wildly  
✗ Pretend they're simple
