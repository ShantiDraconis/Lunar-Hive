# Governance

## Structure

The Lunar Hive operates under **curated governance**.

This is not a democratic project. This is an **archival and research foundation** with clear stewardship.

## Roles

### Maintainers
- Define scope and direction
- Accept or reject contributions
- Enforce quality standards
- Manage repository structure

### Contributors
- Submit proposals through issues
- Participate in discussions
- Provide corrections or clarifications
- Follow contribution guidelines

### Observers
- Read and reference materials
- Link to content
- Discuss ideas externally

## Decision-Making

### What Gets Included

Content is accepted based on:
- **Rigor**: Clear logic, evidence, or mathematical foundation
- **Relevance**: Alignment with documented scope
- **Clarity**: Accessible to serious readers
- **Completeness**: Self-contained or properly referenced

### What Gets Rejected

Content is rejected if it:
- Lacks evidence or clear reasoning
- Falls outside defined scope
- Contains promotional material
- Duplicates existing content
- Violates conduct standards

## Transparency

All decisions are made publicly in:
- Issue discussions
- Pull request reviews
- Commit messages
- Documentation updates

## Evolution

This governance model may evolve as the project matures. Changes will be documented and announced.

## Authority

Final authority rests with the founding maintainers. This is explicit and intentional.

The goal is **quality and coherence**, not consensus.
