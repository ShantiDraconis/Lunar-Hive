# 🐝 Lunar Hive

**Canonical repository and public archive of the Ecletic S system**

---

## What Is This?

The Lunar Hive is a **rigorous, curated public archive** for research and documentation across:

- **Mathematics & Logic** — Millennium Problems, zero over zero, limits and collapse
- **Language & Symbolism** — Harappan script research, symbol systems
- **Engineering & Systems** — Architecture, prototyping, risk, sustainability integration
- **Sustainability** — Closed-loop models, resource accounting, human rights
- **Cultural Systems** — Olympics as ritual, cohesion mechanism, production challenge
- **Epistemology** — How we know what we know, evidence standards, falsifiability

This is not a course. This is not a forum. This is not marketing.

**This is an archive — built to last, open to read, curated for quality.**

## Core Principles

1. **Silence is intentional** — Not everything is explained immediately
2. **Limits are not errors** — Boundaries reveal structure
3. **Clarity over speed** — Rigor matters more than volume
4. **Systems reveal themselves at their boundaries** — Watch the edges
5. **Observation over persuasion** — Think independently
6. **Integration over isolation** — Ideas are connected
7. **Evidence over authority** — Claims stand on their merits

**Full principles**: [`00_MANIFEST/PRINCIPLES.md`](00_MANIFEST/PRINCIPLES.md)
