# Community Contributions

## Overview

This directory is for **high-quality contributions from the community** that add value to the Lunar Hive but don't fit neatly into existing axes.

This is **not** a free-for-all. All content here is **curated and reviewed**.

## Structure

### `/accepted_contributions/`

Contains community-submitted work that has been:
- Reviewed by maintainers
- Found to meet evidence and quality standards
- Accepted for inclusion in the archive

Each contribution should include:
- Author attribution
- Date of acceptance
- Brief context/rationale for inclusion
- Proper citations and references

- How it relates to Lunar Hive scope
- Evidence/sources you'll use

### 2. Discussion
Maintainers and community discuss:
- Alignment with scope and principles
- Quality and evidence standards
- Where it fits (if not in existing axes)

### 3. Develop
Create content following:
- `/CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines

- Existing content style and structure

### 4. Review
Submit via pull request or provide draft for review:

## Current Status

## Examples of What Could Go Here

- **Cross-axis analysis**: Deep dive connecting multiple domains in novel way
- **Historical case study**: Ancient systems analysis (not fitting cleanly into Harappan)
- **Methodological essay**: How to approach certain types of problems
- **Replication study**: Testing claims from published research
- **Philosophical exploration**: Rigorous thinking on boundaries and limits

All subject to review and acceptance.

## Why This Exists

The Lunar Hive is **curated**, not democratic. But curation doesn't mean closed.

This space allows:
- Community to contribute meaningfully
- Quality to be maintained
- Valuable work to be included even if it doesn't fit existing structure
- Recognition for serious contributors

**Balance**: Open to quality contributions, closed to noise.
