# Engineering

## Overview

This directory focuses on **system design, prototyping methodology, risk assessment, and safety frameworks** under real-world constraints.

Engineering is where abstract principles meet physical reality — and where mistakes have consequences.

## Contents

### Core Files

**`system_architecture.md`** (planned)  
Principles of structuring complex systems: modularity, interfaces, redundancy, scalability

**`prototyping.md`** (planned)  
Iterative development methodology: build, test, fail, learn, iterate

**`risk_and_safety.md`** (planned)  
Frameworks for identifying and mitigating hazards: FMEA, FTA, HAZOP

**`sustainability_links.md`** (planned)  
Integration with sustainability axis: resource flows, circular design, long-term thinking

**`case_studies/`** (planned)  
Documented examples of successful and failed systems

---

## Core Principles

1. **Constraints define the problem** (not obstacles)
2. **Prototype over perfection** (iterate based on reality)
3. **Safety is not optional** (analyze and mitigate risks)
4. **Integrate sustainability** (resource, environment, ethics)

See `/00_MANIFEST/PRINCIPLES.md` and `/docs/axes/ENGINEERING.md`

## Focus Areas

### System Architecture
How to structure complex systems for robustness, maintainability, and scalability

### Prototyping
How to develop through testing (not just theory)

### Risk & Safety
How to identify failure modes and design safe systems

### Sustainability
How to integrate resource constraints and environmental ethics

## Standards

- Design standards (ISO, ANSI, IEEE)
- Safety regulations (OSHA, etc.)
- Documentation requirements
- Ethical considerations

**No weapons, surveillance, or exploitation projects.**

## Contributing

### Good Contributions
- Documented case studies (success or failure)
- Risk analysis methodologies
- Sustainable design principles
- Standards and best practices

### Not Helpful
- Code dumps without context
- Projects without analysis
- Ignoring safety considerations
- Incomplete documentation

See `/CONTRIBUTING.md`
