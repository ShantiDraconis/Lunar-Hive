# Zero Over Zero

## Overview

This directory explores **0/0** and indeterminate forms — boundary conditions where standard arithmetic frameworks collapse into limit analysis.

This is not just math trivia. This is a fundamental pattern: **systems have limits, and limits are informative**.

## Key Concepts

### Indeterminate ≠ Undefined
- **Undefined**: No value exists (e.g., 1/0 → ∞)
- **Indeterminate**: Value depends on approach (e.g., 0/0 → depends on limit)

### Collapse as Information
When arithmetic "fails" at 0/0, this reveals:
- Boundaries of the framework
- Where new methods are needed (limits)
- Structure of mathematical systems

### Universal Pattern
Collapse at boundaries appears in:
- Mathematics (0/0, Gödel incompleteness)
- Physics (singularities)
- Engineering (system failures)
- Ecology (resource exhaustion)
- Language (paradoxes, breakdown of meaning)

## Connections

**To Millennium Problems**: Riemann, Navier-Stokes involve limit behavior  
**To Engineering**: Numerical stability, singularities in simulations  
**To Sustainability**: Resource depletion as collapse (resource → 0)  
**To Epistemology**: Limits of knowledge frameworks
