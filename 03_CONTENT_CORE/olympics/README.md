# Olympics

## Overview

This directory examines the Olympic Games as a **cultural system**: ritual, social cohesion mechanism, narrative structure, and massive production challenge.

This is not sports commentary. This is systems analysis of large-scale cultural phenomena.

## Core Questions

1. **What is the function of the Olympics?** (stated vs. actual)
2. **What makes ritual "work"?** (repetition, symbolism, participation, emotion)
3. **How do you build for temporary use?** (permanent legacy vs. white elephants)

See `/docs/axes/OLYMPICS.md` for full discussion

## Key Themes

### Ritual and Symbolism
- Opening/closing ceremonies
- Torch, rings, flags, anthems
- Medal ceremonies
- Shared global experience

### Narrative Construction
- Hero stories (triumph, adversity, underdog)
- Media framing
- What gets told, what gets left out

### Production Challenges
- Housing 10,000+ athletes
- Security for high-profile target
- Construction timelines (7 years typical)
- Budget overruns (almost universal)
- Environmental impact

### Economic Reality
- Costs: Billions (often 2-4x budget)
- Revenue: Broadcasting, sponsorships
- Legacy: Mixed (benefits vs. debt)

## Connections

**To Engineering**: Temporary infrastructure, risk at scale, logistics  
**To Sustainability**: Massive resource use, environmental impact  
**To Harappan**: Historical precedents (Ancient Greek Olympics)  
**To Epistemology**: Narrative vs. evidence, marketing vs. measurement

## Critical Perspectives

### Critiques
- Political propaganda tool
- Displaces local populations
- Cost overruns bankrupt cities
- Environmental destruction
- Commercialization undermines ideals

### Defenses
- Athletic excellence showcase
- International goodwill
- Economic stimulus (debatable)
- Inspires youth

**Lunar Hive**: Acknowledge both. Analyze with evidence.

## Ethical Note

Olympics involve:
- Human rights issues
- Economic exploitation
- Environmental destruction potential
- Political propaganda risks

**We will not ignore these for comfort.**

**Why Include Olympics?**

They demonstrate:
- System thinking at scale
- Ritual function
- Resource/time limits
- Collapse (abandoned facilities, debt)
- Integration (engineering + culture + sustainability)

**Olympics are a complete, flawed, revealing system.**
