# Harappan Script Research

## Overview

This directory documents research into the **Harappan (Indus Valley) script** — an undeciphered ancient writing system from c. 3300–1300 BCE.

**All hypotheses are clearly labeled. Evidence standards are strict. Speculation is acknowledged as such.**

## Current Theories

### Dravidian Hypothesis
**Status**: Most prominent, not proven  
**Proponents**: Asko Parpola, others  
**Falsifiable by**: Contradictory linguistic patterns, bilingual texts

### Indo-Aryan Hypothesis
**Status**: Weak, not widely accepted  
**Problems**: Chronology, linguistic evidence

### Language Isolate
**Status**: Null hypothesis (default without evidence)

### Not Full Writing System
**Status**: Debated  
**Evidence**: Short inscriptions, limited contexts

**See `/docs/axes/HARAPPAN.md` for full discussion**

## Methodology

### Data Limitations
- Average inscription: ~5 symbols
- No bilingual texts (no Rosetta Stone)
- 4,000+ year gap
- Limited archaeological context

### Analytical Approach
- Statistical analysis (frequency, co-occurrence)
- Comparative linguistics (test language family hypotheses)
- Archaeological context (when, where, how used)
- Falsifiability (every hypothesis must be testable)

## Falsifiability Requirements

Every hypothesis about Harappan script must specify:
1. What would prove it correct?
2. What would prove it wrong?
3. What evidence currently supports it?
4. What evidence contradicts it?

**If it can't be falsified, it's not scientific.**

## Connections

**To Epistemology**: Perfect case study in hypothesis vs. fact  
**To Sustainability**: Ancient urban planning, resource management  
**To Engineering**: Standardization, durability of systems

## Ethical Considerations

- Respect cultural heritage
- Avoid nationalist distortion
- Acknowledge colonial research history
- Don't sensationalize or overstate certainty

## Resources

**Guide**: See `/docs/axes/HARAPPAN.md` for overview and resources

**Key Sources**:
- Parpola, A. *Deciphering the Indus Script*
- Possehl, G. *Indus Age: The Writing System*
- Mahadevan, I. *The Indus Script: Texts, Concordance and Tables*

**Warning**: Many popular sources make unsupported claims. Check academic sources.

## Contributing

### Good Contributions
- Statistical analyses with clear methodology
- Linguistic parallels with evidence
- Archaeological context from published sources
- Error corrections with citations

### Not Helpful
- "These symbols look like..." (pattern-seeking without rigor)
- Nationalist arguments
- New "decipherments" without testing
- Dismissal of academic consensus without cause
