# Sustainability

## Overview

This directory examines **closed-loop resource systems, resource accounting, ecological constraints, and human rights integration** in system design.

Sustainability is not marketing. It's physics, mathematics, and ethics applied to resource systems.

## Contents

### Core Files

**`closed_loop_models.md`** (planned)  
Circular economy principles, industrial ecology, biomimicry

**`resource_accounting.md`** (planned)  
Methods for tracking material and energy flows: MFA, LCA, ecological footprint

**`human_rights_constraints.md`** (planned)  
Environmental justice, indigenous rights, equity, intergenerational ethics

**`ecological_limits.md`** (planned)  
Planetary boundaries, carrying capacity, climate, biodiversity

## Core Principles

1. **Earth is finite** (physics, not negotiable)
2. **Closed loops prevent collapse** (waste = inefficiency)
3. **Track resources rigorously** (math, not sentiment)
4. **Justice is non-optional** (ethics integrated, not added)

See `/00_MANIFEST/PRINCIPLES.md` and `/docs/axes/SUSTAINABILITY.md`

## Key Concepts

### Closed-Loop vs. Linear
**Linear** (unsustainable): Extract → Use → Discard  
**Closed-Loop** (sustainable): Materials ↔ Use ↔ Recovery ↔ Regeneration

### Resource Accounting
Track inputs, stocks, flows, outputs, sinks  
If extraction > regeneration → unsustainable

### Carrying Capacity
Maximum sustainable population/consumption  
Overshoot → collapse

### Human Rights
Sustainability must be just, not just efficient  
No exploitation, sacrifice zones, or displacement

## Connections

**To Engineering**: Sustainable design, resource constraints  
**To Mathematics**: Optimization under limits, dynamic systems  
**To Harappan**: Ancient resource management, civilization decline  
**To Olympics**: Large-scale resource use, temporary infrastructure

## Critical Issues

- Climate change (physical reality, IPCC consensus)
- Water scarcity
- Soil degradation
- Biodiversity loss
- Resource depletion

**These are not political opinions. They are measurable phenomena.**

---

## Methodologies

- Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
- Material Flow Analysis (MFA)
- Ecological Footprint
- Carbon/water accounting
- EROI (Energy Return on Investment)

---

## Resources

**Guide**: See `/docs/axes/SUSTAINABILITY.md` for overview and resources

**Key Texts**:
- Meadows, D. *Limits to Growth*
- Daly, H. *Steady-State Economics*
- Hawken, P. *Drawdown*
- Rockström, J. "Planetary Boundaries"

## Contributing

### Good Contributions
- Quantitative resource analyses with data
- Case studies of sustainable systems
- Methodology explanations (LCA, MFA)
- Policy analysis with evidence

### Not Helpful
- Greenwashing or marketing
- "Technology will solve everything" (without specifics)
- Denying physical limits or scientific consensus
- Ignoring social justice

See `/CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Ethical Stance

The Lunar Hive acknowledges:
- Physical limits are real
- Climate change is happening (IPCC)
- Current trajectory is unsustainable
- Solutions must be just
- Action is necessary

**If you disagree with physics, this axis is not for you.**
