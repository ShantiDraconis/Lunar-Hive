# Codex Analysis

## Purpose

This section documents the **Codex Indeterminacy** within the Ecletic S framework.

The Codex Indeterminacy is an exploratory symbolic repository.  
Lunar Hive documents its methodology, limits, and integration within the Ecletic S system.

## What This Section Contains

- **Scope and Limits**: What the Codex is and what it is not
- **Methodology Overview**: How symbolic analysis is conducted
- **Epistemic Risks**: Common misreadings and how to avoid them
- **Relation to 0/0**: Connections to mathematical indeterminacy
- **Open Questions**: Current unresolved structures and problems

## Key Distinction

**The Codex explores.**  
**Lunar Hive registers and contextualizes.**

The Codex Indeterminacy is the field of symbolic experimentation.  
Lunar Hive is the canonical archive that documents, analyzes, and frames that experimentation.

## What Belongs Here

✓ Meta-articles about the Codex  
✓ Methodological frameworks  
✓ Integration analysis  
✓ State summaries  

## What Does Not Belong Here

✗ Extensive symbol lists  
✗ Detailed translation hypotheses  
✗ Raw phonetic comparisons  
✗ Experimental tables in progress  

Those remain in the codex-indeterminacy repository.

## Function

This documentation:
- explains what the Codex is
- explains what it is not
- registers why it exists
- protects the system from misreadings
