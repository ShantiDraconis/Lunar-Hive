# Open Questions Summary

## Current State

The Codex Indeterminacy is ongoing work.  
These questions remain unresolved.

## Structural Questions

### 1. Pattern Stability
Do symbolic patterns remain consistent across contexts, or do they shift?

**Status**: Under investigation  
**Approach**: Comparative frequency analysis

### 2. Hierarchical Organization
Is there evidence of hierarchical structure within symbolic systems?

**Status**: Partially explored  
**Approach**: Positional and relational mapping

### 3. Cross-System Resonance
Where do symbolic patterns converge across unrelated systems?

**Status**: Early observation phase  
**Approach**: Multi-system comparative study

## Methodological Questions

### 4. Falsification Criteria
What constitutes a failed hypothesis in symbolic comparison?

**Status**: Framework defined, application in progress  
**Approach**: Test against edge cases

### 5. Limits of Comparison
At what point does symbolic comparison become unfalsifiable?

**Status**: Boundary testing ongoing  
**Approach**: Constraint mapping

## Epistemic Questions

### 6. Signal vs. Noise
How is meaningful pattern distinguished from coincidence?

**Status**: Active refinement  
**Approach**: Statistical and structural filters

### 7. The Role of Silence
When should analysis stop?

**Status**: Principle established, application evolving  
**Approach**: Epistemic humility as method

## Integration Questions

### 8. Codex and 0/0
Can symbolic indeterminacy inform mathematical indeterminacy, or only the reverse?

**Status**: Conceptual alignment confirmed, bidirectional exploration pending  
**Approach**: Cross-domain analysis

### 9. External Validation
What external frameworks can test Codex hypotheses?

**Status**: Under consideration  
**Approach**: Seeking interdisciplinary dialogue

## Why These Questions Matter

Open questions demonstrate:
- Intellectual honesty
- Ongoing rigor
- Awareness of limits

Unresolved problems are not weaknesses.  
They are invitations for precise thinking.

## A Note on Progress

Some questions may remain open indefinitely.  
This is acceptable within a framework of indeterminacy.

The goal is not closure.  
The goal is clarity about what can and cannot be known.
