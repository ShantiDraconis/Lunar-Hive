# Epistemic Risks

## Common Misreadings

The Codex Indeterminacy is vulnerable to specific misinterpretations.

### Risk 1: Confusing Exploration with Assertion

**The error**:  
Treating exploratory hypotheses as claimed discoveries.

**The correction**:  
Hypotheses are tools, not conclusions.

### Risk 2: Expecting Translation

**The error**:  
Assuming the Codex aims to "decode" meaning.

**The correction**:  
The Codex compares structures, not meanings.

### Risk 3: Demanding Certainty

**The error**:  
Criticizing the work for not providing definitive answers.

**The correction**:  
Indeterminacy is the framework, not a failure.

### Risk 4: Misunderstanding Silence

**The error**:  
Interpreting restraint as incompleteness.

**The correction**:  
Silence signals epistemic humility, not absence.

## Protective Framing

To reduce misreading:
- State what the work is not
- Define boundaries explicitly
- Anticipate likely critiques
- Maintain methodological clarity

## Why This Matters

Without protective framing:
- Hasty readers accuse "forced translation"
- Critics target imagined claims
- The system appears weaker than it is

With protective framing:
- Criticism targets actual methodology
- The work demonstrates rigor
- Epistemic maturity is visible

## A Note on Vulnerability

All exploratory work risks misreading.  
The Codex accepts this risk but does not invite it.
