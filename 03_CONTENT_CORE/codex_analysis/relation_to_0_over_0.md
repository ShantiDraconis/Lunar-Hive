# Relation to 0/0

## Parallel Structures

The Codex Indeterminacy and the concept of 0/0 share foundational principles.

### Indeterminacy as Framework

Both operate within indeterminacy:
- 0/0 is mathematically indeterminate
- The Codex is symbolically indeterminate

Neither seeks to "resolve" indeterminacy.  
Both explore what structure exists within it.

### Limits as Boundaries

In mathematics, limits reveal behavior near indeterminate points.  
In symbolic analysis, constraints reveal patterns near ambiguity.

The Codex applies limit-thinking to symbolic systems.

## Methodological Resonance

### 0/0 Teaches:
- Not all undefined expressions are errors
- Structure exists within indeterminacy
- Restraint is epistemologically sound

### The Codex Applies:
- Symbolic ambiguity is not failure
- Patterns exist without fixed meaning
- Exploration precedes conclusion

## Integration within Ecletic S

The relationship is not metaphorical.  
It is structural.

Both address the same question:  
**What can be known when certainty is unavailable?**

## Epistemic Symmetry

| 0/0 | Codex Indeterminacy |
|-----|---------------------|
| Mathematical indeterminacy | Symbolic indeterminacy |
| Limits reveal structure | Constraints reveal patterns |
| Does not resolve | Does not translate |
| Explores boundary behavior | Explores structural ambiguity |

## Why This Connection Matters

The Codex is not isolated.  
It participates in a broader investigation of indeterminate systems.

Recognizing this connection:
- Strengthens the framework
- Clarifies the methodology
- Demonstrates coherence across domains
