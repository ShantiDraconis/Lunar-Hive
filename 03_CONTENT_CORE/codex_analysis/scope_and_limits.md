# Scope and Limits

## What the Codex Indeterminacy Is

The Codex Indeterminacy is:
- An exploratory symbolic repository
- A field for testing symbolic patterns
- A methodological experiment in indeterminacy
- A tool for examining limits of translation

## What the Codex Indeterminacy Is Not

The Codex is not:
- A translation project
- A claim of decoded meaning
- A finished linguistic system
- A theory requiring belief

## The Role of Hypothesis

Every structure in the Codex is provisional.  
Hypotheses are tools for exploration, not conclusions.

Confusing hypothesis with assertion weakens criticism.

## Boundaries

The Codex operates within clear boundaries:
- Symbolic, not semantic
- Comparative, not declarative
- Structural, not interpretive
- Exploratory, not conclusive

## Why These Limits Matter

Without defined limits:
- Critics confuse exploration with claim
- Readers impose certainty where none exists
- The system appears fragile

With defined limits:
- The work remains testable
- Critique targets the method, not imagined conclusions
- Scientific maturity is demonstrated
