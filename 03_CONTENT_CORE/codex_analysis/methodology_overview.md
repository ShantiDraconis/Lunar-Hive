# Methodology Overview

## Core Principles

The Codex Indeterminacy follows a structured methodology:

1. **Observation before interpretation**  
   Patterns are noted, not explained.

2. **Comparison, not translation**  
   Symbolic structures are compared across systems without claiming equivalence.

3. **Falsifiability over flexibility**  
   Each hypothesis must be testable and rejectable.

4. **Restraint in conclusion**  
   Silence is maintained when data is insufficient.

## Analytical Framework

### Symbol vs. Sound vs. Function vs. Meaning

- **Symbol**: The visual or structural form
- **Sound**: Phonetic properties, if applicable
- **Function**: Positional or relational role
- **Meaning**: Semantic content (often unavailable)

These are distinct categories.  
Conflating them produces false certainty.

## Comparison Standards

When comparing symbolic systems:
- Structure precedes content
- Patterns precede interpretations
- Frequency precedes uniqueness
- Distribution precedes exceptions

## Risk Management

The methodology includes safeguards:
- No claim without evidence
- No evidence without context
- No context without limits
- No limits without acknowledgment

## Why Methodology Matters

A weak method produces noise.  
A strong method produces falsifiable insight.

The Codex methodology is designed to fail visibly, not quietly.
