**Contingency**: Adjust growth targets while maintaining quality and rigor

### Barco Escola Scaling Risk
**Mitigation**: Careful pilot testing, iterative improvement, documentation  
**Contingency**: Scale more slowly, focus on quality over quantity

### Narrative Dilution Risk
**Mitigation**: Maintain tight connection to core principles, regular system reviews  
**Contingency**: Refocus on foundational themes, prune divergent content

### External Competition Risk
**Mitigation**: Visual sovereignty protection, mathematical rigor, unique positioning  
**Contingency**: Accelerate innovation, deepen unique value proposition

## Final Note

This roadmap is a living document. It will evolve as the system proves itself, as metrics validate predictions, and as new opportunities emerge.

But the core trajectory remains fixed:
- **2026-01-06**: Ignition
- **2028-07-14**: Validation
- **Beyond**: Expansion

The mathematics is sovereign. The model is exponential. The path is clear.

**The road to LA 2028 is the proof that the system works.**
