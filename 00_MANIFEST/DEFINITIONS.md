# Definitions

## Core Terms

Precise language requires precise definitions. These terms are used throughout the Lunar Hive with specific meanings.

---

### 0/0 (Zero Over Zero)
The indeterminate form in mathematics. Neither zero nor infinity nor any specific number. A **boundary case** that reveals limits of arithmetic frameworks.

**Context**: Central to limit theory, L'Hôpital's rule, and collapse phenomena.

---

### Limit
A boundary where a framework stops being explanatory.

**Not**: An error or failure  
**Is**: Information about the structure itself

**Example**: Division fails at zero. This is a limit of the operation, not a mistake.

---

### Error
A local failure inside a valid framework.

**Not**: A fundamental problem  
**Is**: A correctable mistake within working rules

**Example**: Misapplying a formula is an error. The formula itself having boundaries is a limit.

---

### Collapse
A transition when a structure exhausts itself and gives way to something else.

**Not**: Destruction or failure  
**Is**: Phase transition, boundary crossing, structural shift

**Example**: When approaching 0/0, standard arithmetic collapses into limit analysis.

---

### System
An interconnected set of elements with emergent properties not reducible to parts.

**Characteristics**:
- Has boundaries
- Has internal coherence
- Interacts with environment
- Can exhibit collapse behavior

**Example**: The Ecletic S system as a whole; closed-loop resource models; symbolic structures.

---

### Silence
A deliberate signal, not absence.

**Not**: Lack of knowledge  
**Is**: Intentional non-statement

**When used**:
- Insufficient evidence to speak
- Recognition of boundary
- Refusal to speculate irresponsibly

---

### Integration
The process of connecting disparate elements into a coherent system.

**Not**: Mere addition or collection  
**Is**: Synthesis that creates new structure

**Example**: Connecting mathematical limits to resource boundaries to cultural systems.

---

### Falsifiability
The property of a claim being testable and potentially disprovable.

**Not**: Being wrong  
**Is**: Being checkable

**Example**: "This symbol represents /da/" is falsifiable via linguistic analysis. "This symbol feels powerful" is not.

---

### Rigor
Precision in reasoning and evidence standards.

**Not**: Inaccessible jargon  
**Is**: Clear logic and explicit assumptions

**Example**: Stating axioms before deriving conclusions.

---

### Archive
A durable, organized repository built to last.

**Not**: A feed, blog, or social platform  
**Is**: A reference resource

**Purpose**: Enable future access and verification.

---

### Axis (plural: Axes)
A major conceptual dimension or domain of inquiry within the system.

**Current axes**:
- Mathematics (Millennium Problems, 0/0)
- Language (Harappan)
- Engineering
- Sustainability
- Cultural Systems (Olympics)

---

### Signal
Meaningful information, as opposed to noise.

**Characteristics**:
- Intentional
- Structured
- Interpretable

**Can be**: Words, silence, patterns, boundaries.

## Usage Notes

These definitions are:
- **Prescriptive** within the Lunar Hive
- **Not universal** across all contexts
- **Explicit** to avoid confusion
- **Stable** but refinable with justification

If you encounter a term used differently elsewhere, understand that **context matters**.
