# Epistemology

## How We Know What We Know

The Lunar Hive operates on **explicit epistemological distinctions**.

Not all knowledge is the same. Not all claims have the same status.

## Categories of Knowledge

### 1. Mathematical Proof
**Status**: Certain within axiomatic system

**Characteristics**:
- Follows from axioms via logic
- Reproducible by any competent reviewer
- True by definition within its framework

**Example**: "In standard arithmetic, 2 + 2 = 4"

**Limitation**: Dependent on chosen axioms

---

### 2. Empirical Evidence
**Status**: Provisionally true, falsifiable

**Characteristics**:
- Based on observation or measurement
- Reproducible under specified conditions
- Subject to revision with new data

**Example**: "Water boils at 100°C at standard pressure"

**Limitation**: Inductive, not deductive

---

### 3. Model or Hypothesis
**Status**: Proposed framework, not yet verified

**Characteristics**:
- Internally consistent structure
- Makes testable predictions
- Awaits confirmation or falsification

**Example**: "This symbol pattern suggests a phonetic value of /da/"

**Limitation**: Speculative until tested

---

### 4. Speculation or Intuition
**Status**: Exploratory, not knowledge claim

**Characteristics**:
- May lack clear test criteria
- Useful for generating hypotheses
- Not to be confused with established fact

**Example**: "Perhaps the collapse phenomenon indicates a deeper structure"

**Limitation**: Pre-scientific stage

---

## Critical Distinctions

### Proof ≠ Model
A proof is **necessary truth** within a system.  
A model is a **possible explanation** awaiting verification.

### Evidence ≠ Proof
Evidence makes something **likely** or **supported**.  
Proof makes something **certain** within defined rules.

### Absence of Evidence ≠ Evidence of Absence
Lack of data is not itself data.  
Silence can be signal, but requires interpretation.

## Standards in the Lunar Hive

### Every Claim Must Be
1. **Labeled** with its epistemological status
2. **Supported** with appropriate evidence or reasoning
3. **Falsifiable** or acknowledged as unfalsifiable
4. **Clear** about its limitations

### Examples of Proper Labeling

✓ "**Proven**: The limit as x→0 of sin(x)/x = 1 (by L'Hôpital's rule)"  
✓ "**Hypothesis**: Harappan glyph X may represent sound Y (testable via frequency analysis)"  
✓ "**Observation**: The Olympics create cross-cultural cohesion (documented historically)"  
✓ "**Speculation**: Collapse may indicate phase transition (exploratory, not established)"

## What This Prevents

- **Conflating** speculation with fact
- **Claiming** certainty where only probability exists
- **Hiding** assumptions behind confident language
- **Dismissing** valid challenges as ignorance

---

## What This Enables

- **Trust** through transparency
- **Rigor** through explicit standards
- **Progress** through clear feedback
- **Integrity** through honest limitation

---

## Evolution of Knowledge

Knowledge status can change:
- Speculation → Hypothesis (when structured)
- Hypothesis → Supported (with evidence)
- Supported → Proven (if mathematical)
- Proven → Limited (if axioms change)

This is **not weakness**. This is **how knowledge works**.

---

## Meta-Epistemology

This epistemology itself is:
- **Model**: A framework for organizing knowledge claims
- **Provisional**: Open to refinement
- **Pragmatic**: Designed for utility, not ultimate truth
- **Transparent**: Its assumptions are stated

---

## Questions?

If you're unsure how to classify a claim, ask in discussions.

Clarity is more valuable than certainty.
