## What Is Outside the Lunar Hive

### Explicitly Not Included
- Personal opinions without evidence
- Marketing or commercial content
- Unstructured speculation
- Claims without falsifiability
- Emotional appeals or persuasion
- Political advocacy
- Religious doctrine
- Entertainment content

### Why These Boundaries Exist
The Lunar Hive is an **archive**, not a platform. Its value depends on:
- **Rigor**: Every claim is grounded or labeled as speculative
- **Clarity**: Structure over noise
- **Integrity**: No dilution of purpose
- **Durability**: Built to last decades

## How Scope Evolves

Scope can expand only when:
1. New axis is clearly defined
2. Maintains consistency with principles
3. Adds value without dilution
4. Approved by maintainers

Scope will never contract to exclude existing rigorous work.
