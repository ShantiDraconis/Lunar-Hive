# 00_MANIFEST

## Canonical Declaration

The **Lunar Hive** is the public archive and conceptual foundation of the **Ecletic S system**.

This directory contains the **immutable core** — the principles, definitions, and boundaries that define what this project is and what it is not.

## What This Is

A rigorous, public archive for:
- Mathematical and logical exploration
- Symbolic and linguistic research  
- Engineering and sustainability frameworks
- Cultural and ritual systems analysis

## What This Is Not

- A theory claiming to be complete
- A commercial product or service
- A social movement or ideology
- A course or educational program
- A forum for casual discussion

## Structure

### PRINCIPLES.md
The foundational principles that guide all work in this system.

### DEFINITIONS.md
Precise definitions of key terms and concepts.

### SCOPE.md
Clear boundaries of what is included and excluded.

### EPISTEMOLOGY.md
The nature of knowledge, proof, and evidence in this system.

## Usage

Anyone exploring the Lunar Hive should **start here**.

These documents rarely change. When they do, changes are documented and explained.

## Authority

The manifest is maintained by the founding stewards of this archive.

It exists to provide clarity, not to claim ultimate truth.
