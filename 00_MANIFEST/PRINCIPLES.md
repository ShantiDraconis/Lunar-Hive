# Principles

## Foundational Principles

These principles guide all work within the Lunar Hive system. They are not negotiable, but they are explicable.

### 1. Silence is Intentional
Absence of statement is not absence of thought. Silence can be:
- A signal of boundary
- A refusal to speculate without ground
- Recognition that some things cannot yet be said

**Do not mistake silence for ignorance.**

### 2. Not Every Limit is an Error
When a framework stops working, this is **information**, not failure.
- Limits reveal structure
- Collapse is transition, not destruction
- The edge of a map is as important as its center

**Limits are where new understanding begins.**

### 3. Clarity Matters More Than Speed
Rushing to conclusions obscures truth. This archive values:
- Precise language over casual phrasing
- Structure over volume
- Rigor over productivity

**Better to say nothing than to say it poorly.**

### 4. Systems Reveal Themselves at Their Boundaries
The most interesting behavior happens:
- Where division fails (0/0)
- Where languages break down
- Where resources exhaust
- Where rules become ambiguous

**Watch the edges, not just the center.**

### 5. This Space Favors Observation Over Persuasion
The Lunar Hive is not here to convince. It is here to:
- Present ideas clearly
- Document reasoning
- Enable others to think independently

**You are not obligated to agree. You are expected to think.**

### 6. Integration Over Isolation
Ideas are connected:
- Mathematics informs symbolism
- Engineering requires sustainability
- Culture reflects structure

**The system is not reducible to parts.**

### 7. Evidence Over Authority
Claims stand or fall on:
- Logical consistency
- Empirical support
- Falsifiability

**Who says it matters less than whether it's true.**

## How to Use These Principles

- **In contribution**: Ensure your work respects these boundaries
- **In discussion**: Reference principles when relevant
- **In reading**: Use principles to understand decisions

These are not rules for punishment. They are patterns for coherence.
