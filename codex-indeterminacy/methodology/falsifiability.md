# Falsifiability Criteria

## Purpose

This document establishes how hypotheses in the Codex Indeterminacy can be tested, weakened, or disproven. Falsifiability is essential for maintaining scientific rigor.

## Core Principle

**A hypothesis that cannot be falsified cannot be tested.**

Every claim, comparison, or interpretation must include explicit conditions under which it would be:
- Disproven (falsified completely)
- Weakened (confidence reduced)
- Strengthened (confidence increased)

## Falsifiability Framework

### Well-Formed Hypothesis Structure

```
Hypothesis: [Statement of what is proposed]

Supporting Evidence:
- [Evidence point 1]
- [Evidence point 2]
- [Evidence point 3]

Alternative Explanations:
- [Alternative 1]
- [Alternative 2]

Falsification Criteria:
- Would be disproven if: [condition 1]
- Would be weakened if: [condition 2]
- Would be strengthened if: [condition 3]

Current Confidence: [Low/Medium/High]
```

## Types of Falsification

### 1. Evidence-Based Falsification

**Hypothesis is falsified if:**
- Direct counter-evidence is discovered
- Archaeological dating contradicts temporal assumptions
- New inscriptions contradict proposed patterns
- Independent analysis reaches opposite conclusion with stronger evidence

**Example:**
- Hypothesis: "Symbol X appears only in seal inscriptions"
- Falsified if: "Symbol X is found in pottery inscriptions"

### 2. Pattern-Based Falsification

**Hypothesis is weakened if:**
- Proposed pattern doesn't hold across larger sample
- Counter-examples outnumber supporting examples
- Statistical analysis shows no significant correlation
- Pattern appears in unrelated contexts (suggests coincidence)

**Example:**
- Hypothesis: "Symbol Y always appears word-finally"
- Weakened if: "Symbol Y found word-initially in 30% of new samples"

### 3. Contextual Falsification

**Hypothesis is invalidated if:**
- Temporal context proves no overlap existed
- Geographic distance makes contact implausible without trade evidence
- Cultural isolation is documented archaeologically
- Material analysis contradicts proposed connection

**Example:**
- Hypothesis: "Script A influenced Script B"
- Falsified if: "Script A postdates Script B by 500 years"

### 4. Methodological Falsification

**Hypothesis is rejected if:**
- Based on circular reasoning
- Cherry-picks evidence
- Ignores established counter-evidence
- Uses invalid comparison methods

**Example:**
- Hypothesis: "Symbol similarity proves contact"
- Rejected if: "Only 3 of 400 symbols show similarity"

## Domain-Specific Falsification

### Symbol Analysis

**Geometric Hypothesis**
- Falsified by: Measurements contradicting proposed geometry
- Weakened by: High variance in actual forms
- Strengthened by: Consistent geometric properties across corpus

**Distributional Hypothesis**
- Falsified by: Statistical analysis showing random distribution
- Weakened by: Low frequency or scattered occurrence
- Strengthened by: Systematic distribution patterns

### Phonetic Hypothesis

**Sound Correspondence**
- Falsified by: Articulatory impossibility
- Weakened by: No parallel in related languages
- Strengthened by: Systematic sound changes in language family

**Phoneme Inventory**
- Falsified by: Violates typological universals
- Weakened by: Rare or unusual for language family
- Strengthened by: Matches typological expectations

### Script Comparison

**Historical Connection**
- Falsified by: No temporal or geographic overlap
- Weakened by: No archaeological evidence of contact
- Strengthened by: Documented trade routes or cultural exchange

**Structural Parallel**
- Falsified by: Opposite structural patterns discovered
- Weakened by: Parallel found in many unrelated scripts (universal feature)
- Strengthened by: Rare structural feature shared systematically

## Confidence Level Adjustment

### When to Reduce Confidence

- Counter-evidence emerges
- Alternative explanation becomes stronger
- Sample size increases and pattern weakens
- Peer review identifies methodological flaws
- Assumptions are questioned by new findings

### When to Increase Confidence

- Multiple independent sources confirm
- Alternative explanations are systematically excluded
- Larger sample size strengthens pattern
- Independent researchers replicate findings
- New evidence aligns with prediction

### When to Reject Hypothesis

- Direct falsification occurs
- Methodological flaws cannot be corrected
- Counter-evidence is overwhelming
- Better alternative hypothesis emerges
- Circular reasoning is identified

## Testing Protocol

### Before Publishing Hypothesis

1. **State explicitly** - what is claimed?
2. **List evidence** - what supports it?
3. **Consider alternatives** - what else could explain this?
4. **Define falsification** - what would disprove it?
5. **Assess confidence** - how strong is the evidence?

### During Review

1. **Test against counter-examples**
2. **Apply statistical analysis** where applicable
3. **Consider typological universals**
4. **Check methodological rigor**
5. **Assess alternative explanations**

### After New Evidence

1. **Re-evaluate** - does hypothesis still hold?
2. **Adjust confidence** - up or down based on new data
3. **Document changes** - why was confidence adjusted?
4. **Update falsification criteria** - based on new insights
5. **Consider rejection** - if falsified, document and archive

## Examples of Well-Falsified Hypotheses

### Example 1: Symbol Frequency Hypothesis

```
Hypothesis: Symbol A is the most frequent symbol in the corpus.

Evidence:
- Preliminary count: 150 occurrences in 50 inscriptions
- Next most frequent: 85 occurrences

Falsification Criteria:
- Falsified if: Comprehensive count shows another symbol more frequent
- Weakened if: Difference is within statistical error
- Strengthened if: Larger corpus maintains this proportion

Confidence: Medium (limited sample size)
```

### Example 2: Phonetic Correspondence

```
Hypothesis: Symbol B represents sound /ta/.

Evidence:
- Appears in position consistent with /ta/ in related languages
- Frequency matches /ta/ frequency in comparable languages
- Articulatory transition patterns fit /ta/

Falsification Criteria:
- Falsified if: Position analysis contradicts /ta/ placement
- Weakened if: Frequency doesn't match /ta/ in expanded corpus
- Strengthened if: Phonetic environment consistently supports /ta/

Confidence: Low (speculative, requires more evidence)
```

### Example 3: Script Influence

```
Hypothesis: Script X influenced Symbol Set Y in Script Z.

Evidence:
- 12 symbols show visual similarity
- Temporal overlap: 200 years
- Geographic proximity: 500km
- Trade routes documented

Falsification Criteria:
- Falsified if: Dating revised to show no overlap
- Weakened if: Similar symbols found in unrelated scripts (universal forms)
- Strengthened if: Archaeological evidence shows direct cultural contact

Confidence: Medium (contextual support, but limited direct evidence)
```

## Red Flags for Unfalsifiable Claims

🚩 Avoid hypotheses that:
- Use vague language ("might", "could", without criteria)
- Don't specify what would disprove them
- Rely on absence of evidence rather than evidence
- Can be reinterpreted to fit any outcome
- Make claims about internal meaning or intention without external validation

## Maintenance

Falsification criteria should be:
- **Explicit** - clearly stated
- **Specific** - concrete conditions, not vague
- **Realistic** - actually testable with available methods
- **Updated** - revised when new methods or evidence emerge
- **Documented** - changes tracked with rationale

*Falsifiability protects the Codex from unfounded claims and maintains scientific integrity.*
