# Comparison Rules

## Purpose

This document defines rigorous rules for comparing symbols, scripts, and phonetic systems to avoid spurious correlations and maintain epistemic integrity.

## Fundamental Rules

### Rule 1: Similarity ≠ Connection
Visual or phonetic similarity does not prove historical connection. Similar forms may arise independently through:
- Universal human cognitive patterns
- Practical constraints of writing media
- Limited geometric possibilities
- Convergent evolution of symbolic systems

**Required:** Document why similarity might indicate connection beyond chance.

### Rule 2: Multiple Independent Points
A valid comparison requires multiple independent points of similarity:
- Not just one symbol, but patterns across symbol sets
- Not just form, but also distribution, frequency, position
- Not just visual, but structural and functional parallels

**Minimum threshold:** At least 3-5 independent points of comparison.

### Rule 3: Context Matters
Comparisons must consider:
- **Temporal context** - when were these systems in use?
- **Geographic context** - where were they used?
- **Cultural context** - evidence of contact or influence?
- **Material context** - similar writing materials or purposes?

**If contexts don't overlap:** explain the rationale for comparison.

### Rule 4: Asymmetry Acknowledgment
When comparing scripts, acknowledge asymmetries:
- One system deciphered, one not
- One well-documented, one fragmentary
- One systematic study, one preliminary

**Avoid:** Assuming equal understanding of both systems.

### Rule 5: Alternative Explanations
For every comparison, document:
- Null hypothesis (similarity by chance)
- Alternative explanations (other reasons for similarity)
- Counter-evidence (what doesn't fit the comparison)

**If alternatives aren't weaker:** comparison is premature.

## Specific Comparison Types

### Visual/Geometric Comparison

**Valid when:**
- Multiple symbols share structural patterns (not just one)
- Patterns include distinctive features (not just basic shapes)
- Frequency distributions correlate
- Positional usage parallels exist

**Invalid when:**
- Based on simple geometric shapes (circles, lines, crosses)
- Cherry-picked examples ignore non-matching symbols
- No consideration of independent invention
- Ignores historical context

**Template:**
```
Symbol A (System 1) ↔ Symbol B (System 2)
- Form similarity: [describe]
- Frequency correlation: [yes/no, data]
- Positional parallel: [yes/no, examples]
- Context overlap: [temporal/geographic]
- Alternative explanations: [list]
- Confidence: [low/medium/high]
```

### Phonetic Comparison

**Valid when:**
- Based on comparative linguistics (not speculation)
- Multiple phonemes show systematic correspondence
- Articulatory transitions are natural
- Pattern follows known sound change principles

**Invalid when:**
- Based on superficial sound similarity only
- Ignores systematic phonetic correspondences
- Violates known articulatory constraints
- Assumes one-to-one symbol-to-sound mapping

**Template:**
```
Phoneme A (Language 1) ↔ Phoneme B (Language 2)
- Comparative evidence: [sources]
- Systematic pattern: [yes/no, describe]
- Articulatory naturalness: [assessment]
- Counter-examples: [list]
- Confidence: [low/medium/high]
```

### Structural Comparison

**Valid when:**
- Grammatical patterns show systematic parallels
- Word order or syntactic structures correlate
- Morphological patterns align
- Functional categories match

**Invalid when:**
- Based on universal linguistic features
- Superficial structural similarity only
- No consideration of typological commonality
- Ignores alternative structural analyses

**Template:**
```
Structure A (System 1) ↔ Structure B (System 2)
- Pattern type: [grammatical/syntactic/morphological]
- Systematic parallel: [describe]
- Typological assessment: [rare/common]
- Alternative analyses: [list]
- Confidence: [low/medium/high]
```

## Cross-Script Comparison Matrix

When comparing across scripts, assess:

| Dimension | Evidence Level | Documentation Required |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Temporal overlap | High/Medium/Low/None | Date ranges, uncertainties |
| Geographic proximity | High/Medium/Low/None | Distances, trade routes |
| Cultural contact | Documented/Possible/Unlikely | Archaeological evidence |
| Structural parallels | Multiple/Few/None | Specific examples |
| Visual similarities | Systematic/Scattered/None | Symbol inventories |
| Functional parallels | Clear/Possible/None | Usage patterns |

**Minimum for valid comparison:** Medium evidence in at least 3 dimensions.

## Confidence Calibration

### High Confidence Comparison
- Multiple independent points (5+)
- Strong contextual overlap
- Systematic patterns, not isolated cases
- Published academic support
- Falsification criteria passed

### Medium Confidence Comparison
- Several points of similarity (3-5)
- Some contextual overlap
- Patterns present but incomplete
- Preliminary academic discussion
- Some alternative explanations weaker

### Low Confidence Comparison
- Few points of similarity (1-3)
- Weak or no contextual overlap
- Isolated examples
- Little academic support
- Strong alternative explanations remain

### Experimental Comparison
- Preliminary exploration only
- Contextual justification unclear
- No systematic pattern yet
- Alternatives not yet assessed

## Falsification Criteria

Every comparison must include criteria that would weaken or disprove it:

**Examples:**
- "If Symbol X is found in pre-contact contexts, this comparison is weakened"
- "If phonetic analysis of Language Y shows no corresponding sound, this is falsified"
- "If new inscriptions show different positional patterns, this is weakened"
- "If archaeological dating shifts, contextual overlap is lost"

## Red Flags

🚩 Avoid comparisons that:
- Rely on a single point of similarity
- Ignore temporal or geographic distance without justification
- Cherry-pick supporting examples
- Use vague language ("feels similar", "reminds me of")
- Lack falsification criteria
- Ignore published counter-evidence
- Claim certainty without sufficient evidence

## Review Process

All comparisons undergo:
1. **Self-review** - do all rules apply?
2. **Alternative assessment** - are alternatives weaker?
3. **Evidence check** - is evidence sufficient?
4. **Confidence calibration** - is confidence level appropriate?
5. **Falsification documentation** - are criteria explicit?
