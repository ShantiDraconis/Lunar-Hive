# Epistemic Limits

## Purpose

This document explicitly acknowledges the boundaries of knowledge when working with undeciphered scripts, ancient languages, and symbolic systems. Recognizing these limits is essential for intellectual honesty.

## Fundamental Limitations

### 1. Historical Distance

**The Problem:**
- We are separated from these systems by thousands of years
- Original contexts are lost or fragmentary
- Cultural frameworks are alien to us
- Intentions of creators are unknowable

**Implications:**
- Cannot assume modern concepts apply to ancient systems
- Must acknowledge projection of our frameworks
- Should maintain multiple interpretations
- Cannot recover full original meaning with certainty

**What We Can Do:**
- Work with material evidence that survives
- Compare across related systems
- Build probabilistic models
- Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly

### 2. Incomplete Evidence

**The Problem:**
- Most ancient writing materials have decayed
- Survival is selective (durable materials bias sample)
- Archaeological contexts are often disturbed
- Many inscriptions are fragmentary

**Implications:**
- Cannot claim complete symbol inventories
- Frequency distributions may be skewed
- Patterns might be artifacts of preservation
- Missing evidence creates blind spots

**What We Can Do:**
- Work with available corpus acknowledging limits
- State sample sizes explicitly
- Note preservation biases
- Update as new discoveries emerge

### 3. Undeciphered Status

**The Problem:**
- For scripts like Harappan: no confirmed translation
- No bilingual texts (Rosetta Stone equivalent)
- No native speaker testimony
- No explicit grammar or dictionary

**Implications:**
- Cannot verify phonetic interpretations directly
- Semantic claims remain hypothetical
- Grammatical structure is inferred, not confirmed
- All readings are provisional

**What We Can Do:**
- Focus on structural analysis first
- Compare with related systems carefully
- Maintain multiple hypotheses
- Distinguish levels of confidence

### 4. Cognitive Biases

**The Problem:**
- Pattern-seeking is innate and can create false patterns
- Confirmation bias favors evidence supporting hypotheses
- Recency bias privileges recent interpretations
- Cultural bias projects our worldview onto ancient systems

**Implications:**
- May see patterns where none exist
- May ignore counter-evidence
- May privilege familiar interpretations
- May miss culturally alien concepts

**What We Can Do:**
- Actively seek counter-evidence
- Document rejected hypotheses
- Include alternative interpretations
- Use statistical controls for pattern recognition

### 5. Linguistic Typology Constraints

**The Problem:**
- Don't know which language family (if any)
- Don't know linguistic type (isolating, agglutinative, etc.)
- Can't assume universal linguistic features
- May be dealing with unique systems

**Implications:**
- Comparative linguistics has limited application
- Phonetic reconstructions are highly speculative
- Grammatical analysis may be misdirected
- Unique features may be missed

**What We Can Do:**
- Survey typological possibilities
- Avoid assuming specific linguistic type
- Consider multiple linguistic models
- Acknowledge when typology is uncertain

### 6. Multivalency and Context-Dependence

**The Problem:**
- Symbols may have multiple meanings (polysemy)
- Context may determine meaning
- Same symbol may represent different sounds/meanings
- Writing systems may be mixed (logographic + phonetic)

**Implications:**
- One-to-one symbol-to-meaning mappings are oversimplified
- Context is crucial but often unavailable
- Frequency analysis alone is insufficient
- System may be more complex than assumed

**What We Can Do:**
- Allow for multiple values per symbol
- Document contextual variation
- Model mixed systems
- Avoid forcing simplicity

### 7. Transmission and Copying Errors

**The Problem:**
- Inscriptions may contain errors
- Symbols may be degraded or unclear
- Standards may vary across time/space
- Individual variation exists

**Implications:**
- Not all variation is meaningful
- Some "unique" forms may be errors
- Standardization may be assumed incorrectly
- Outliers may mislead analysis

**What We Can Do:**
- Consider error margins
- Distinguish scribal variation from systematic pattern
- Note degradation in assessment
- Don't over-interpret individual cases

## Domain-Specific Limits

### Symbol Analysis Limits

**What We Can Know:**
- Geometric properties (objectively measurable)
- Frequency distributions (in available corpus)
- Positional patterns (where they appear)
- Combination rules (what appears together)

**What We Cannot Know:**
- Original semantic meaning (without bilingual text)
- Phonetic value (without phonetic indicators)
- Cultural significance (without ethnographic context)
- Author intention (without testimony)

### Phonetic Reconstruction Limits

**What We Can Estimate:**
- Possible phonemes based on comparative linguistics
- Articulatory constraints
- Typological likelihood
- Sound change patterns in language families

**What We Cannot Determine:**
- Exact pronunciation without native speakers
- Tone, stress, or prosody
- Dialectal variation
- Historical sound changes without written record

### Semantic Interpretation Limits

**What We Can Infer:**
- Grammatical function (from position, combination)
- Structural roles (subject, object, modifier)
- Possible referents (from archaeological context)
- Comparative semantics (from related languages)

**What We Cannot Assert:**
- Definitive word meanings
- Full sentence translations
- Cultural concepts
- Narrative content with certainty

## Methodological Safeguards

### Against Overconfidence

1. **Probabilistic framing** - use confidence levels
2. **Multiple hypotheses** - maintain alternatives
3. **Explicit uncertainty** - state what we don't know
4. **Falsification criteria** - define limits of claims
5. **Peer review** - external validation

### Against Pattern Projection

1. **Statistical controls** - test if pattern exceeds chance
2. **Cross-validation** - test on held-out data
3. **Alternative patterns** - consider competing patterns
4. **Null hypothesis** - test against random baseline
5. **Replication** - verify pattern in independent samples

### Against Cultural Projection

1. **Comparative breadth** - survey multiple cultures
2. **Typological awareness** - know linguistic diversity
3. **Archaeological grounding** - use material context
4. **Explicit assumptions** - state cultural frameworks used
5. **Alternative worldviews** - consider non-Western models

## Epistemic Humility in Practice

### Language to Use

✅ **Appropriate:**
- "suggests", "may indicate", "possibly"
- "hypothesis", "tentative", "preliminary"
- "if confirmed", "pending evidence"
- "one interpretation", "alternative reading"

❌ **Inappropriate:**
- "proves", "definitely", "certainly"
- "is", "means", "represents" (without qualification)
- "deciphered", "solved", "decoded"
- "the correct interpretation"

### Claims to Avoid

- Definitive decipherment without bilingual confirmation
- Complete translations of undeciphered texts
- Certain semantic meanings
- Absolute historical connections
- Cultural or spiritual narratives as fact

### Claims We Can Make

- Structural patterns in symbol use
- Statistical distributions and correlations
- Comparative possibilities with other systems
- Multiple alternative interpretations
- Levels of confidence in hypotheses

## Living with Uncertainty

### Accepting Limits

Some questions may remain unanswered:
- We may never fully decipher certain scripts
- Some symbols may remain ambiguous
- Historical connections may stay uncertain
- Multiple interpretations may persist

**This is acceptable.** Exploring indeterminacy has value even without definitive resolution.

### Value of Indeterminate Knowledge

Even without certainty, we gain:
- Understanding of structural patterns
- Comparative insights across systems
- Methodological refinements
- Documented hypotheses for future testing
- Clearer boundaries of knowledge

### When to Say "We Don't Know"

**Say it when:**
- Evidence is insufficient
- Multiple interpretations remain equally viable
- Counter-evidence is strong
- Methodology reaches its limits
- Question exceeds available data

**Saying "we don't know" is not failure. It is honesty.**

## Revision and Growth

These limits are not fixed:
- New discoveries may expand knowledge
- Better methods may overcome current limitations
- Interdisciplinary approaches may offer new angles
- Technology may reveal hidden evidence

**Update this document as limits shift.**

## Conclusion

Epistemic limits are not weaknesses—they are guardrails against overreach. By acknowledging what we cannot know, we protect the integrity of what we can know.

**The Codex Indeterminacy operates within these limits deliberately and transparently.**
