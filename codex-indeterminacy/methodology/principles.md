# Principles of Symbolic and Linguistic Analysis

## Core Principles

### 1. Indeterminacy as Foundation
Symbolic and linguistic systems, especially undeciphered ones, contain inherent ambiguity. This ambiguity is not a problem to solve but a reality to document and explore.

### 2. Multiple Hypotheses
No single interpretation should be privileged without substantial, falsifiable evidence. Multiple competing hypotheses must coexist until evidence excludes alternatives.

### 3. Traceability
Every hypothesis, comparison, or mapping must be traceable to:
- Source materials (inscriptions, tablets, archaeological context)
- Comparative evidence (other scripts, languages, phonetic systems)
- Methodological reasoning (why this comparison is valid)

### 4. Falsifiability
Each hypothesis must include explicit criteria for what would disprove or weaken it. Unfalsifiable claims are excluded.

### 5. Epistemic Humility
We acknowledge the limits of our knowledge:
- Historical gaps in evidence
- Cognitive biases in interpretation
- Cultural distance from source materials
- Incomplete archaeological record

### 6. Non-Semantic Priority
When analyzing symbols, begin with non-semantic properties:
- Geometric form
- Spatial relationships
- Frequency and distribution
- Positional patterns

Only after exhausting structural analysis do we propose semantic or phonetic interpretations.

### 7. Probabilistic Language
Avoid definitive claims. Use:
- "suggests" rather than "proves"
- "possible" rather than "is"
- "may indicate" rather than "means"
- "hypothesis" rather than "conclusion"

### 8. Comparative Method
Cross-linguistic and cross-script comparison is valid when:
- Geographic or temporal proximity is documented
- Similar structural patterns exist
- Multiple independent parallels support the comparison
- Alternative explanations are considered

### 9. Rejection Documentation
Rejected hypotheses are valuable. Document:
- What was tested
- Why it was rejected
- What evidence excluded it
- What alternatives emerged

### 10. Open Questions Preserved
Never delete unresolved questions or paradoxical cases. They reveal the boundaries of current understanding and guide future exploration.

## Analytical Framework

### Structural Analysis
1. **Form** - geometric properties, symmetry, complexity
2. **Position** - where symbols appear (initial, medial, final, isolated)
3. **Frequency** - distribution patterns across texts
4. **Combination** - how symbols combine with others
5. **Context** - archaeological and material context

### Phonetic Hypothesis
1. **Comparative evidence** - sounds in related languages
2. **Articulatory possibility** - human phonetic constraints
3. **Pattern matching** - structural parallels to known systems
4. **Frequency correlation** - common sounds vs. common symbols
5. **Alternative readings** - multiple phonetic possibilities

### Semantic Exploration
1. **Contextual clues** - archaeological context, iconography
2. **Comparative semantics** - meanings in related languages
3. **Structural function** - grammatical or syntactic role
4. **Alternative meanings** - multiple semantic possibilities
5. **Confidence assessment** - explicit uncertainty markers

## Methodological Constraints

### What We Avoid
- Circular reasoning (using interpretation to prove interpretation)
- Cherry-picking (selecting only supporting evidence)
- Overconfidence (claiming more than evidence supports)
- Anachronism (imposing modern concepts on ancient systems)
- Cultural projection (assuming our cultural frameworks apply)

### What We Maintain
- Systematic comparison across multiple sources
- Explicit documentation of uncertainty
- Multiple competing interpretations
- Falsification criteria for each hypothesis
- Regular review against new evidence

## Quality Standards

### Hypothesis Quality
A well-formed hypothesis includes:
- Clear statement of what is proposed
- Evidence supporting the hypothesis
- Alternative interpretations considered
- Falsification criteria
- Confidence level assessment

### Comparison Quality
A valid comparison includes:
- Explicit basis for comparison (geographic, temporal, structural)
- Multiple points of parallel evidence
- Consideration of counter-examples
- Assessment of alternative explanations

### Documentation Quality
All content must be:
- Traceable to sources
- Reproducible by others
- Falsifiable in principle
- Updated when new evidence emerges
