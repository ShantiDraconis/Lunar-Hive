# Cross-Language Comparisons

## Purpose

Systematic comparison of linguistic features across potentially related language families to inform Harappan analysis.

## Status

📋 **Reference framework** - Based on comparative linguistics.

## Language Families for Comparison

### Dravidian
- Geographic presence in region
- Proposed connection to Harappan
- Well-reconstructed proto-language

**Comparative value:** High (if connection valid)
**Confidence in connection:** Low-Medium

### Indo-Aryan
- Later dominance in region
- Chronological issues with Harappan
- Well-documented in Vedic Sanskrit

**Comparative value:** Medium (possible later influence or substrate)
**Confidence in connection:** Low

### Austro-Asiatic (Munda)
- Present in eastern India
- Ancient presence possible
- Less studied for Harappan connection

**Comparative value:** Low-Medium
**Confidence in connection:** Very low

## Phonological Comparisons

See `phonemes/` directory for detailed phonetic analysis.

## Morphological Comparisons

### Dravidian Characteristics
- Agglutinative morphology
- Suffixing (not prefixing)
- Verb-final word order
- Inclusive/exclusive "we" distinction

### Indo-Aryan Characteristics
- Fusional morphology (Sanskrit)
- Rich case system
- Verb-second tendency in Vedic
- Gender agreement

## Syntactic Comparisons

### Word Order Typology

**SOV (Subject-Object-Verb):** Dravidian, Japanese
**SVO (Subject-Verb-Object):** English, Chinese
**VSO (Verb-Subject-Object):** Celtic, Classical Arabic

**Harappan:** Unknown. Short texts insufficient for word order determination.

## Lexical Comparisons

**Challenge:** Without decipherment, direct lexical comparison impossible.

**Approach:** If phonetic values were hypothesized, compare to:
- Proto-Dravidian reconstructions
- Sanskrit roots
- Munda vocabulary

**Current status:** Premature without phonetic decipherment.
