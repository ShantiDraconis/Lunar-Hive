# Symbol-to-Function Mappings

## Purpose

Maps symbols to proposed functions (determinative, phonetic, logographic, grammatical) based on distributional patterns.

## Status

📋 **Working hypotheses** - Based on statistical patterns.

## Function Categories

### Phonetic
Represents sound, not meaning directly.
**Evidence:** High frequency, wide distribution, position-independent

### Logographic
Represents word or morpheme.
**Evidence:** Medium frequency, specific contexts, possibly pictographic

### Determinative
Semantic classifier, not pronounced.
**Evidence:** Position-specific, precedes/follows certain symbol classes

### Grammatical
Marks grammatical relationships (case, number, tense, etc.)
**Evidence:** Position-specific (often final), high frequency

### Numeric
Represents quantity.
**Evidence:** Repetition patterns, specific contexts (see `symbols/numeric_symbols.md`)

## Distributional Evidence

**High-frequency, position-independent → Phonetic or common grammatical**
**Medium-frequency, context-specific → Logographic**
**Position-specific, high-frequency → Grammatical or determinative**
**Repetitive patterns → Numeric**

## Proposed Functional Classifications

**Note:** All classifications tentative, based on preliminary distributional analysis.

### Confidence Levels

- **Experimental:** Initial hypothesis, minimal evidence
- **Low:** Some distributional support
- **Medium:** Clear statistical pattern
- **High:** Strong evidence from multiple sources

**Current Harappan classifications:** Mostly experimental to low confidence.
