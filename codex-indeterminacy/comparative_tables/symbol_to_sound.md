# Symbol-to-Sound Mappings

## Purpose

Documents hypothetical mappings between symbols and phonetic values.

## Status

🔄 **Highly speculative** - No confirmed sound values for Harappan.

## Epistemic Warning

**We do not know the sounds of Harappan symbols.**

Any symbol-to-sound mapping is:
- Extremely tentative
- Based on comparison, not proof
- Subject to complete revision
- Likely wrong in current form

## Methodological Constraints

For any proposed sound value:
1. **Comparative basis** required (related language data)
2. **Distributional evidence** (frequency, position patterns)
3. **Articulatory possibility** (see `phonemes/resonance.md`)
4. **Multiple alternatives** maintained
5. **Explicit low confidence**

## Proposed Mappings (Illustrative Only)

**Note:** No mappings included in this version. All such mappings are provisional and require extensive justification.

## Falsification Criteria

Any symbol-sound hypothesis would be falsified by:
- Bilingual showing different value
- Decipherment contradicting assignment
- Distributional analysis contradicting phonetic hypothesis
- Typological impossibility
