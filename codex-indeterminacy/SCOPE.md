# Scope Definition

## Purpose

This document explicitly defines what is included and excluded from the Codex Indeterminacy repository.

## Languages Analyzed

### Primary Focus
- **Harappan/Indus Valley script** - undeciphered script systems
- **Proto-Sumerian** - early cuneiform predecessors
- **Proto-Egyptian** - early hieroglyphic systems
- **Proto-Sinaitic** - early alphabetic systems
- **Runic systems** - various runic traditions
- **Pictographic systems** - including Mesoamerican and North American indigenous systems

### Comparative Context
- **Sanskrit** - phonetic and structural comparison
- **Proto-Indo-European reconstructions** - comparative linguistics
- **Dravidian languages** - regional linguistic context
- **Ancient Semitic languages** - script development context

## Historical Periods

- **Bronze Age** (~3300-1200 BCE) - primary focus for Harappan
- **Early Iron Age** (~1200-600 BCE) - transitional script systems
- **Archaic periods** - early forms of later-standardized scripts
- **Proto-historic periods** - pre-literate to literate transitions

## What Is Included

✅ **Symbolic analysis** - form, geometry, repetition, spatial relationships  
✅ **Phonetic possibilities** - sound inventories, transitions, articulation  
✅ **Structural patterns** - syntax, position, grammatical function  
✅ **Comparative hypotheses** - cross-linguistic and cross-script comparisons  
✅ **Multiple interpretations** - alternative readings and rejected paths  
✅ **Indeterminacy models** - theoretical frameworks for ambiguity  
✅ **Open questions** - unresolved symbols and paradoxical cases  

## What Is Excluded

❌ **Definitive translations** - no final word-to-word translations  
❌ **Narrative closure** - no complete stories or spiritual narratives  
❌ **Absolute historical claims** - no definitive historical assertions  
❌ **Mathematical proofs** - no closed mathematical systems (belongs to other repositories)  
❌ **Manifestos or doctrine** - no ideological or spiritual declarations  
❌ **Modern language instruction** - not a language learning resource  
❌ **Unsourced speculation** - all hypotheses must be traceable  

## Epistemic Boundaries

### What We Can Do
- Compare structural patterns across scripts
- Map phonetic possibilities based on comparative linguistics
- Document geometric and symbolic relationships
- Maintain multiple competing hypotheses
- Track confidence levels and falsification criteria

### What We Cannot Do
- Claim definitive decipherment of undeciphered scripts
- Assert single correct interpretations
- Provide linear narrative translations
- Prove historical connections without archaeological evidence
- Override academic consensus without substantial justification

## Relationship to Other Systems

### Ecletics (Private)
- Internal decision-making system
- Not documented in this repository
- Provides coordination and direction

### Lunar-Hive (Public Canonical Archive)
- Repository for mature, stabilized content
- Broader conceptual framework
- Archives what emerges from Codex exploration

### Codex Indeterminacy (This Repository)
- Public exploration space
- Maintains indeterminacy and alternatives
- Documents process, not just conclusions

## Scope Evolution

This scope may expand or contract based on:
- New archaeological discoveries
- Academic peer review
- Community feedback
- Internal coordination from ecletics

**Any scope changes will be documented with rationale.**
