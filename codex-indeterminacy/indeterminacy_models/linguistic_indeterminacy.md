# Linguistic Indeterminacy

## Purpose

Examines linguistic indeterminacy specifically—how language-related ambiguity affects interpretation of undeciphered scripts.

## Core Issues

### Language Family Unknown
- Cannot use comparative method reliably
- Sound correspondences unknowable
- Grammatical expectations uncertain
- Lexical reconstructions impossible

### Phonetic-Graphic Mismatch
- Unknown relationship between symbols and sounds
- Cannot validate phonetic hypotheses
- Orthographic conventions unknown

### Semantic Indeterminacy
- Context insufficient for meaning
- Cultural distance prevents interpretation
- Polysemy cannot be distinguished from homophony

## Types of Linguistic Indeterminacy

### Phonological
- Cannot determine phoneme inventory
- Cannot know phonotactic constraints
- Cannot identify prosodic features (tone, stress, length)

### Morphological
- Cannot determine word structure
- Cannot identify morphemes reliably
- Cannot distinguish affixes from roots

### Syntactic
- Cannot determine word order
- Cannot identify grammatical relationships
- Cannot distinguish phrase types

### Semantic
- Cannot determine lexical meanings
- Cannot access cultural semantics
- Cannot distinguish literal from figurative

### Pragmatic
- Cannot determine speech acts
- Cannot access conversational implicatures
- Cannot interpret social deixis

## Working Within Linguistic Indeterminacy

### Typological Constraints
Even without knowing specific language, typological universals constrain possibilities.

### Statistical Patterns
Distributional patterns reveal structure even without understanding content.

### Comparative Frameworks
Related languages (if identified) provide hypotheses to test.

### Multiple Models
Maintain multiple linguistic models simultaneously:
- Model A: Dravidian-type language
- Model B: Indo-Aryan-type language
- Model C: Language isolate
- Model D: Multiple languages

**Test each model against evidence; none assumed correct.**

## Indeterminacy and Translation

**Traditional goal:** Translate text (X → Y)
**Under indeterminacy:** Map possibility space (X → {Y₁, Y₂, Y₃...})

**Cannot provide "the translation"—can provide:**
- Range of possible translations
- Constraints on translations
- What translations are ruled out
