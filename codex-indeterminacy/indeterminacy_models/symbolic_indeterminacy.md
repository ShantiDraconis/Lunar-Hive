# Symbolic Indeterminacy

## Purpose

Explores symbolic indeterminacy as a theoretical framework for understanding undeciphered scripts and ambiguous symbolic systems.

## Core Concept

**Symbolic indeterminacy:** The state where a symbol's meaning cannot be uniquely determined from available evidence.

## Sources of Indeterminacy

### 1. Polysemy
Single symbol has multiple meanings.
**Example:** Egyptian symbols often have 2-3 values (logographic + phonetic + determinative)

### 2. Context-Dependence
Meaning determined by context, which may be lost.

### 3. Historical Distance
Original semantic field unknown or alien to modern interpreters.

### 4. Incomplete Evidence
Missing texts, damaged inscriptions, limited corpus.

### 5. Unknown Language
Cannot anchor symbols to linguistic meanings.

### 6. Multiple Writing Conventions
Regional or temporal variants create ambiguity.

## Indeterminacy vs. Ambiguity

**Ambiguity:** Multiple clear interpretations possible (can be resolved with more information)
**Indeterminacy:** Cannot determine interpretation even in principle (without external breakthrough)

**Harappan:** Currently indeterminate, not merely ambiguous.

## Working with Indeterminacy

### Accept Multiple States
- Symbol X may be phonetic OR logographic OR both
- Text may represent Language A OR Language B
- Structure may be Type 1 OR Type 2

**Do not force closure prematurely.**

### Map Possibility Space
Rather than seeking "the answer," map the range of possibilities:
- Which interpretations are ruled out
- Which remain viable
- What evidence would distinguish them

### Embrace Productive Uncertainty
Indeterminacy is not failure—it guides research:
- What would resolve this indeterminacy?
- What new evidence is needed?
- What methods could distinguish alternatives?

## Indeterminacy and the 0/0 Framework

The 0/0 (zero divided by zero) concept represents fundamental indeterminacy:
- Not an error
- Not solvable by conventional means
- Requires reframing the question
- Multiple interpretations simultaneously valid/invalid

**Symbolic parallel:** Undeciphered symbols exist in 0/0 state—not meaningless, but indeterminate.

## Levels of Indeterminacy

### Symbol-Level
Individual symbol's value unknown.

### Syntactic-Level
Grammatical relationships undetermined.

### Semantic-Level
Meaning of texts unknown.

### Systemic-Level
Type of writing system uncertain.

### Linguistic-Level
Language affiliation unknown.

**Harappan:** Indeterminate at all levels.

## Resolution Pathways

### What Could Resolve Indeterminacy?

1. **Bilingual inscription** - Definitive breakthrough
2. **Language identification** - Comparative method applicable
3. **Longer texts** - More context
4. **Phonetic indicators** - Clues to sound values
5. **External evidence** - Archaeological context

**Reality:** Some indeterminacy may be permanent.
