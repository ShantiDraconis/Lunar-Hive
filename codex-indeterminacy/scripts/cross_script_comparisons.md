# Cross-Script Comparisons

## Purpose

Systematic comparison of structural and visual features across multiple ancient scripts to identify typological patterns and potential historical connections.

## Status

📋 **Framework document** - Detailed comparisons in progress.

## Comparison Methodology

See `methodology/comparison_rules.md` for rigorous comparison criteria.

**Key principles:**
- Visual similarity ≠ historical connection
- Multiple independent points required
- Context (temporal, geographic, cultural) essential
- Alternative explanations must be considered

## Script Comparison Matrix

### Structural Features

| Script | Symbol Count | System Type | Direction | Text Length | Status |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Harappan | ~400-700 | Unknown (mixed?) | Right-to-left | Very short (4-5 avg) | Undeciphered |
| Proto-Cuneiform | ~1200+ | Logo-syllabic | Variable | Variable | Partially deciphered |
| Proto-Elamite | ~1000+ | Unknown | Variable | Short-medium | Undeciphered |
| Egyptian (early) | ~700-800 | Logo-phonetic | Variable | Variable | Deciphered |
| Linear A | ~90 | Syllabic+logo | Left-to-right | Short-medium | Undeciphered |
| Linear B | ~90 | Syllabic+logo | Left-to-right | Medium-long | Deciphered |

## Visual Form Comparisons

### Geometric Similarities

**Universal forms** (found in most scripts):
- Vertical/horizontal lines
- Circles and semicircles
- Cross patterns
- Triangular shapes

**Interpretation:** These are fundamental human drawing patterns, not evidence of connection.

### Distinctive Forms

**Harappan distinctive features:**
- "Fish" symbol and variants
- "Jar" symbol variants
- Specific compound patterns

**Comparison status:** Some superficial similarities to other scripts noted but no convincing systematic parallels.

**Confidence:** Low for historical connections.

## Functional Comparisons

### Administrative Usage

**Common pattern:**
- Harappan seals
- Cuneiform tablets
- Egyptian labels
- Cretan seals and tablets

**Interpretation:** Writing emerges for record-keeping cross-culturally.

**Relevance:** Functional convergence, not necessarily historical connection.

### Seal Technology

**Harappan vs. Mesopotamian seals:**
- Both used for identification
- Different aesthetics and iconography
- Possible trade contact (seals found across regions)

**Question:** Did seal technology transfer independently of script?

**Confidence:** Medium (trade contact documented, script influence unproven)

## Temporal and Geographic Context

### Contemporaneous Scripts (~2500-1900 BCE)

**Potential contact zones:**
- Harappan ↔ Proto-Elamite: Geographic proximity
- Harappan ↔ Mesopotamia: Trade routes documented
- Proto-Elamite ↔ Sumerian: Direct contact

**Evidence for Harappan contact:**
- Harappan seals found in Mesopotamia
- Mesopotamian artifacts in Indus sites
- No bilingual inscriptions found

**Interpretation:** Trade contact ≠ script transfer necessarily.

## Typological Patterns

### Mixed Systems

**Pattern:** Many ancient scripts mix logograms and phonetic elements.

**Scripts using this:**
- Sumerian/Akkadian cuneiform
- Egyptian hieroglyphics
- Maya glyphs
- Possibly Harappan

**Relevance:** If Harappan is mixed, it follows common typological pattern.

**Confidence:** Medium (typologically reasonable)

### Symbol Inventory Size

**~100-200 symbols:** Typically syllabaries
**~400-700 symbols:** Typically mixed logo-syllabic
**~1000+ symbols:** Logographic with extensive phonetic use
**~20-40 symbols:** Alphabetic/abjad

**Harappan (~400-700):** Fits mixed system profile best.

## Specific Symbol Comparisons (Preliminary)

**Caveat:** Individual symbol comparisons must be treated cautiously per `comparison_rules.md`.

### Documented Similarities

Some researchers have noted visual similarities between specific Harappan and other symbols. 

**Status of these claims:**
- **Mostly weak** - Based on single symbol similarities
- **Alternative explanation:** Convergent evolution of simple forms
- **Requires:** Multiple systematic parallels for convincing argument

**Current assessment:** No convincing systematic cross-script visual correspondence.

**Confidence:** Low for claimed connections.

## Open Questions

1. Are visual similarities between Harappan and other scripts meaningful or coincidental?
2. Did trade contact lead to script influence?
3. Can structural analysis reveal historical connections?
4. What would constitute convincing evidence of script relationship?

*Cross-script comparison requires rigor to avoid spurious correlations.*

**Status:** Framework established. Detailed comparisons pending.
