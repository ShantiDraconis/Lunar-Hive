# Ambiguous Structures

## Purpose

Documents structural patterns in texts that have multiple possible interpretations.

## Principle

Structural ambiguity reveals limits of analysis and guides hypothesis testing.

## Types of Structural Ambiguity

### Segmentation Ambiguity
**Problem:** Where do words/morphemes begin and end?

**Example:** Does "ABC" parse as:
- [A][BC]
- [AB][C]
- [ABC] (single unit)

**Harappan:** Without word boundaries, segmentation uncertain.

### Positional Ambiguity
**Problem:** Does position determine function?

**Questions:**
- Initial position = determinative or common word?
- Final position = grammatical marker or honorific?
- Medial position = content or transition?

**Status:** Multiple models possible.

### Hierarchical Ambiguity
**Problem:** Are there embedded structures?

**Questions:**
- Do some symbols modify others?
- Are there phrase-level structures?
- Is structure flat or hierarchical?

**Status:** Short texts prevent determination.

### Directional Ambiguity
**Problem:** Reading direction established (right-to-left) but exceptions exist.

**Questions:**
- Are exceptions errors, special cases, or alternative system?
- Is boustrophedon (alternating direction) present?
- Do some texts read differently?

**Status:** Consensus right-to-left, but edge cases remain.

## Specific Structural Puzzles

### Repeated Sequences
**Observation:** Some symbol sequences repeat across inscriptions.

**Interpretation A:** Fixed phrases, titles, or formulae
**Interpretation B:** Common words or grammatical structures
**Interpretation C:** Names or place names

**Status:** Cannot distinguish without decipherment.

### Symmetric Structures
**Observation:** Some texts show palindromic or symmetric patterns.

**Interpretation A:** Deliberate aesthetic or ritual structure
**Interpretation B:** Coincidence in short texts
**Interpretation C:** Reflects syllabic symmetry in language

**Status:** Unclear.

### Positional Regularities
**Observation:** Some symbols strongly prefer certain positions.

**Interpretation A:** Grammatical function (determinatives, affixes)
**Interpretation B:** Formulaic text structure (greeting, closing)
**Interpretation C:** Lexical—certain words naturally appear first/last

**Status:** Multiple viable interpretations.

## Why Structures Remain Ambiguous

### Short Texts
- Insufficient syntactic context
- Cannot observe complex structures
- Limited pattern instances

### Unknown Language
- Cannot predict grammatical structures
- Cannot assume word order
- Cannot identify phrase types

### Limited Text Variety
- Mostly seals (specific genre)
- May not represent full linguistic range
- Genre-specific structures obscure general grammar

### Multiple Viable Models
- Different linguistic types compatible with evidence
- Typological universals too permissive
- Insufficient evidence to exclude alternatives

## Approaches to Structural Ambiguity

### Typological Modeling
Test multiple linguistic models:
- SOV, SVO, VSO word orders
- Agglutinative, fusional, isolating morphology
- Different grammatical marking strategies

**Evaluate which fits patterns best.**

### Statistical Analysis
- Positional distributions
- Co-occurrence patterns
- Sequence frequencies

**See what constraints emerge.**

### Comparative Analogy
If language family identified, use comparative structures as hypothesis base.

**Test against corpus.**

### Multiple Simultaneous Models
Maintain several structural models:
- Don't force single interpretation
- See which explains most data
- Allow models to coexist

## Open Questions

1. What is the basic syntactic structure of Harappan texts?
2. Are there embedded hierarchical structures?
3. What determines symbol order—syntax, semantics, or formula?
4. Do different text types have different structures?
5. Can structural analysis proceed independent of language identification?

*Structural ambiguity persists until longer texts or decipherment resolves it.*

**Status:** Multiple structural models under consideration.
