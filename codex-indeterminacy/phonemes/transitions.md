# Phonetic Transitions

## Purpose

This document explores possible phonetic transitions and sound changes that may be observable in scripts, even when the phonetic values themselves are uncertain.

## Status

🔄 **Speculative** - Based on typological patterns, not proven Harappan data.

## What Are Phonetic Transitions?

Phonetic transitions are:
- Sound changes over time (diachronic)
- Sound changes in context (synchronic, allophonic)
- Sound changes due to borrowing (contact linguistics)
- Articulatory adjustments between sounds

## Why Study Transitions?

Even without knowing exact phonetic values, transitions may be detectable through:
- Spelling variations
- Symbol substitutions
- Regional differences
- Temporal changes

## Types of Phonetic Transitions

### 1. Assimilation

**Definition:** Sounds become more similar to neighboring sounds.

**Common patterns:**
- Nasal assimilation: /n/ → /m/ before /p, b/ (impossible to pronounce /np/, natural as /mp/)
- Voicing assimilation: /s/ → /z/ between vowels
- Place assimilation: /t/ → /k/ before /k/

**Observable in writing:**
- Spelling variations (if script is phonetic)
- Alternate forms of same word
- Regional variants

**Harappan evidence:** Insufficient data to confirm.
**Confidence:** Hypothetical

### 2. Dissimilation

**Definition:** Sounds become less similar to avoid repetition.

**Common patterns:**
- /r...r/ → /l...r/ (Latin: peregrinus → pellegrino)
- Aspiration dissimilation (Sanskrit: bharati but not *bharathi)

**Harappan evidence:** None yet.
**Confidence:** Speculative

### 3. Lenition (Weakening)

**Definition:** Sounds become less constricted, more vowel-like.

**Common patterns:**
- /p, t, k/ → /b, d, g/ (voicing)
- /b, d, g/ → /β, ð, ɣ/ (fricativization)
- /t/ → /ɾ/ (flapping, as in American English "water")
- Consonant loss intervocalically

**Observable in writing:**
- Later forms show loss of consonants
- Spelling becomes more ambiguous
- Silent letters emerge

**Harappan evidence:** Requires temporal stratification.
**Confidence:** Unknown (no clear diachronic data)

### 4. Fortition (Strengthening)

**Definition:** Sounds become more constricted or emphasized.

**Common patterns:**
- /w, j/ → /gw, gj/ (glide strengthening)
- Voiceless to aspirated stops
- Glottal stop insertion (Arabic, German)

**Harappan evidence:** None.
**Confidence:** Speculative

### 5. Metathesis

**Definition:** Sounds switch positions.

**Common patterns:**
- /ask/ → /aks/ (English: ask → ax)
- Liquid metathesis common (/r/ and /l/)

**Observable in writing:**
- Alternate spellings with reversed consonants

**Harappan evidence:** Would require variant inscriptions.
**Confidence:** Unknown

## Diachronic Sound Changes (Historical)

### If Temporal Stratification Exists

**Early Harappan vs. Late Harappan:**
- Are there detectable differences in symbol usage?
- Do certain symbols disappear or emerge?
- Do symbol combinations change?

**Current status:** Limited temporal stratification in corpus.

### Common Historical Patterns

**Grimm's Law (Indo-European):**
- Systematic consonant shift: /p/ → /f/, /t/ → /θ/, /k/ → /h/
- Example: Latin pater → English father

**Great Vowel Shift (English):**
- Long vowels raised or diphthongized
- Example: /iː/ → /aɪ/ (Middle English "tyme" → Modern "time")

**Dravidian Sound Changes:**
- Weakening of word-initial voicing
- Gemination (consonant doubling)
- Retroflexion of dental consonants

**Relevance:** If language family is identified, expected sound changes can be tested.

## Synchronic Transitions (Allophonic Variation)

### Context-Dependent Pronunciation

**Allophones:** Different pronunciations of same phoneme.

**Examples:**
- /p/ aspirated word-initially [pʰ], unaspirated after /s/ [p]
- /t/ dental before dental, alveolar elsewhere
- /n/ velar before /k, g/ [ŋ]

**Relevance to writing:**
- If script is precise, may mark allophones
- If script is phonemic, allophones not distinguished
- Cannot determine without phonetic knowledge

### Sandhi (Sanskrit Term for Sound Junction)

**Definition:** Changes at word or morpheme boundaries.

**Common patterns:**
- Vowel coalescence: /a + i/ → /e/
- Consonant assimilation at boundaries
- Deletion or insertion of sounds

**Observable in writing:**
- Compound words spelled differently than components
- Boundary markers or their absence

**Harappan evidence:** Would require word boundary identification.
**Confidence:** Unknown

## Articulatory Transitions

### Natural Transition Sequences

**Easy transitions (articulatorily simple):**
- CV (consonant-vowel): universal
- Nasal + stop with same place: /mp/, /nt/, /ŋk/
- Liquid + consonant: /rt/, /lt/

**Difficult transitions (articulatorily complex):**
- Stop + stop with different places: /pt/, /kg/ (less common)
- Complex clusters: /kstr/, /pfl/

**Implication:** Symbol sequences may reflect articulatory ease.

### Phonotactic Constraints

**Universal tendencies:**
- Sonority sequencing: Syllables rise in sonority to peak (vowel), then fall
- Example: /stra/ is natural (s < t < r < a), /atrs/ is unnatural

**Language-specific:**
- Some languages allow /tl/ (Nahuatl), others don't (English)
- Some allow word-initial /ŋ/ (Viet), others don't (English)

**Harappan:** Unknown constraints without phonetic knowledge.

## Comparative Transition Patterns

### Dravidian

**Characteristic changes:**
- Weakening of initial voicing
- Gemination (doubling) of medial consonants
- Retroflexion influenced by /r/
- Vowel harmony in some subgroups

**If Harappan is Dravidian:** Look for these patterns.

### Indo-Aryan

**Characteristic changes:**
- Loss of final consonants in modern languages
- Aspiration contrasts maintained or lost
- Cluster simplification
- Vowel reduction in unstressed syllables

**If Harappan has Indo-Aryan influence:** Look for these patterns.

### Austro-Asiatic (Munda)

**Characteristic changes:**
- Loss of word-final consonants
- Sesquisyllabic structure (minor syllable + major syllable)
- Vowel quality changes

**If Harappan is Munda:** Look for these patterns.

## Statistical Approaches to Transitions

### Symbol Substitution Analysis

**Method:**
- Identify inscriptions that are nearly identical
- Note which symbols differ
- Hypothesize these are phonetically similar

**Example:**
- If inscription A has symbol X and inscription B has symbol Y in same position
- Hypothesis: X and Y may represent similar sounds

**Confidence:** Requires many parallel inscriptions (rare in Harappan).

### Positional Variation

**Method:**
- Track symbol distribution by position
- Note if certain symbols never precede/follow others
- Infer phonetic incompatibility

**Example:**
- If symbol A never follows symbol B
- Hypothesis: Phonetic sequence AB is prohibited (phonotactic constraint)

**Confidence:** Requires large corpus and statistical validation.

## Falsification Criteria

### Would Support Transition Hypothesis:
- Consistent spelling variations across inscriptions
- Temporal stratification shows systematic changes
- Regional variations show geographic patterns
- Parallels with known sound changes in related languages

### Would Weaken Hypothesis:
- Random variation with no pattern
- Alternative explanation (scribal error, not phonetic change)
- Insufficient data to confirm pattern

### Would Falsify:
- Decipherment shows no phonetic relationship between variant symbols
- Archaeological evidence contradicts temporal or geographic assumptions

## Open Questions

1. Are there detectable diachronic changes in Harappan script?
2. Do symbol substitutions reveal phonetic similarity?
3. Are there regional dialects visible in writing?
4. Do phonotactic patterns constrain symbol combinations?
5. Can we identify assimilation or other processes?
6. Does Harappan show sandhi-like phenomena?
