# Base Phoneme Set

## Purpose

This document explores possible phonetic inventories for undeciphered scripts based on comparative linguistics, typological universals, and articulatory constraints.

## Status

🔄 **Highly speculative** - Phonetic reconstruction without native speakers is inherently uncertain.

## Epistemic Warning

**We cannot know the actual sounds of undeciphered languages.**

This document presents:
- Typologically likely phoneme inventories
- Comparisons with related language families
- Articulatory possibilities
- Statistical expectations

**This is NOT:**
- A proven phonetic system
- A definitive phonology
- A translation key

## Methodology

### Comparative Approach
1. Survey related language families (if known/hypothesized)
2. Identify common phonemes across these families
3. Note typological universals
4. Propose probable phoneme inventory

### Typological Approach
1. Survey world's languages for phoneme frequency
2. Identify universal or near-universal sounds
3. Note rare or unusual sounds
4. Propose typologically unmarked inventory

### Articulatory Approach
1. Identify easiest/most natural articulations
2. Note universal articulatory constraints
3. Consider acquisition order (child language)
4. Propose articulatorily simple inventory

## Harappan/Indus Valley: Phonetic Possibilities

### Language Affiliation Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1: Dravidian**
- Geographic proximity to Dravidian languages
- Some scholars propose Dravidian connection
- Confidence: Low (no proof, much debate)

**Hypothesis 2: Indo-Aryan (Early Vedic)**
- Later dominance of Indo-Aryan in region
- But may postdate Harappan
- Confidence: Very low (temporal issues)

**Hypothesis 3: Austro-Asiatic (Munda)**
- Present in region, may be ancient
- Limited comparative work
- Confidence: Very low (speculative)

**Hypothesis 4: Language Isolate**
- May not belong to known family
- Cannot use comparative method
- Confidence: Unknown (absence of evidence)

**Hypothesis 5: Multiple Languages**
- Harappan civilization was large and diverse
- May have multilingual script usage
- Confidence: Possible but complicates analysis

### Phoneme Inventory Construction

**Given uncertainty, propose multiple scenarios:**

#### Conservative Inventory (Typologically Minimal)

**Consonants (13-15):**
- Stops: /p, t, k/ (voiceless)
- Stops: /b, d, g/ (voiced)
- Nasals: /m, n/
- Fricatives: /s/
- Liquids: /l, r/
- Glides: /w, j/

**Vowels (3-5):**
- /a, i, u/ (minimal three-vowel system)
- Possibly: /e, o/ (five-vowel system)

**Total: ~16-20 phonemes**

**Rationale:** Nearly universal phonemes, found in almost all languages.
**Confidence:** Medium (safe assumption, but may be incomplete)

#### Dravidian-Based Inventory

**If Harappan is Dravidian-related:**

**Consonants (~20-25):**
- Stops: /p, t, ṭ, k/ (voiceless)
- Stops: /b, d, ḍ, g/ (voiced)
- Nasals: /m, n, ṇ, ŋ/
- Fricatives: /s, h/
- Liquids: /l, ḷ, r, ṟ/
- Glides: /w, j/
- (Retroflex series: ṭ, ḍ, ṇ, ḷ, ṟ)

**Vowels (10):**
- /a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, e, ē, o, ō/
- Short-long distinction

**Total: ~30-35 phonemes**

**Rationale:** Dravidian languages have retroflexes and vowel length
**Confidence:** Low (assumes Dravidian affiliation)

#### Indo-Aryan-Based Inventory

**If early Indo-Aryan influence:**

**Consonants (~25-30):**
- Stops: /p, t, ṭ, k/ (voiceless unaspirated)
- Stops: /pʰ, tʰ, ṭʰ, kʰ/ (voiceless aspirated)
- Stops: /b, d, ḍ, g/ (voiced unaspirated)
- Stops: /bʰ, dʰ, ḍʰ, gʰ/ (voiced aspirated)
- Nasals: /m, n, ṇ, ŋ/
- Fricatives: /s, ś, ṣ, h/
- Liquids: /l, r/
- Glides: /w, j/

**Vowels (10-12):**
- /a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, e, ai, o, au/ + /ṛ, ṝ/ (vocalic r)

**Total: ~35-40 phonemes**

**Rationale:** Sanskrit shows complex consonant system with aspiration
**Confidence:** Very low (likely anachronistic)

#### Austroasiatic-Based Inventory

**If Munda-related:**

**Consonants (~20-25):**
- Stops: /p, t, c, k/ + /ʔ/ (glottal stop)
- Voiced stops: /b, d, ɟ, g/
- Nasals: /m, n, ɲ, ŋ/
- Fricatives: /s, h/
- Liquids: /l, r/
- Glides: /w, j/

**Vowels (9-12):**
- /i, e, ɛ, a, ə, u, o, ɔ/ +/- length or nasalization

**Total: ~30-35 phonemes**

**Rationale:** Munda languages have specific phonological features
**Confidence:** Very low (speculative connection)

## Typological Universals

### Most Common Phonemes (Cross-Linguistic)

**Consonants appearing in >90% of world's languages:**
- /m, p, b, t, d, k, g, n, s, w, j/

**Vowels appearing in >90% of languages:**
- /a, i, u/

**Implication:** Any phoneme inventory likely includes these.

### Rare Phonemes

**Uncommon in world's languages:**
- Click consonants (Khoisan, some Bantu)
- Pharyngeal consonants (Semitic)
- Tone (common in Asia, Africa; less common in Indo-European)
- Nasal vowels (Romance, African; not universal)

**Implication:** Unless evidence suggests otherwise, assume unmarked inventory.

## Symbol-to-Phoneme Mapping Constraints

### Inventory Size Constraint

**Harappan symbol count:** ~400-700 signs (estimates vary)
**Phoneme inventory:** Typically 20-40 phonemes

**Implication:** Script is NOT purely phonetic (like alphabet).

**Possibilities:**
1. Logographic-phonetic mix (like Egyptian, Sumerian)
2. Syllabary (symbols represent CV combinations)
3. Abjad (consonants only, vowels implied)
4. Abugida (consonants with vowel diacritics)
5. Pure logographic (no phonetic component)

**Confidence:** Cannot determine from symbol count alone.

### Syllable Structure Possibilities

**If syllabary:**
- 20 consonants × 5 vowels = 100 CV syllables
- Add CV, CVC patterns: 200-400 symbols (fits!)
- Hypothesis: Could be syllabary
- Confidence: Low-Medium (possible but unproven)

**If logographic-phonetic mix:**
- Core logograms (200-300)
- Phonetic complements (50-100)
- Determinatives (50-100)
- Total: 300-500 symbols (fits!)
- Hypothesis: Mixed system like Sumerian
- Confidence: Low-Medium (common pattern, but unproven)

## Phonotactic Constraints

### Universal Constraints
- All languages have CV (consonant-vowel) syllables
- Most languages have V (vowel-only) syllables
- Many languages have CVC syllables
- Complex clusters (CCCV) are rarer

**Implication:** Likely syllable structures include CV, V, CVC.

### Language-Family Specific

**Dravidian typical:**
- Prefers open syllables (CV)
- Avoids initial clusters
- Allows final nasals
- Geminate consonants

**Indo-Aryan typical:**
- Allows initial clusters
- Allows complex syllables
- Sanskrit: very permissive phonotactics

**Cannot determine without more evidence.**

## Phonetic Processes

### Common Sound Changes
- Assimilation (sounds becoming more similar)
- Dissimilation (sounds becoming less similar)
- Lenition (weakening of articulation)
- Fortition (strengthening of articulation)
- Metathesis (reordering of sounds)

**Relevance:** If diachronic analysis possible, these processes guide reconstruction.

### Prosodic Features

**Tone:**
- Presence of tone doubles functional phonemes
- Tone languages: /ma/ with high vs. low tone = different words
- Evidence for tone: typically requires native speaker testimony
- Harappan: No way to determine if tonal

**Stress:**
- Placement of emphasis on syllables
- Can be lexical (word-specific) or predictable
- Usually not written in ancient scripts
- Harappan: Unknown

**Length:**
- Vowel or consonant duration distinctions
- Common in Dravidian (vowel length)
- Common in Sanskrit (vowel and consonant length)
- May or may not be marked in writing

## Comparative Phonological Patterns

### Proto-Dravidian Reconstruction
- Reconstructed by linguists
- ~25-30 consonants, ~10 vowels
- Retroflex consonants characteristic
- Verb-final word order (not phonological but syntactic)

**If Harappan is Dravidian:** This inventory is hypothesis base.

### Proto-Indo-European
- Well-reconstructed
- Complex consonant system
- Ablaut (vowel alternation patterns)
- Laryngeals (lost in daughter languages)

**If Harappan has Indo-European contact:** May see borrowings.

## Falsification Criteria

### Would Support Specific Phonology:
- Bilingual inscription discovered
- Clear phonetic indicators in script
- Convincing cognates with known language
- Archaeological linguistic evidence

### Would Weaken Hypothesis:
- Typologically implausible inventory
- Violates articulatory constraints
- Doesn't match symbol inventory size
- Better alternative model emerges

### Would Falsify:
- Definitive decipherment shows different system
- Language affiliation proven different
- Phonetic analysis contradicts articulatory possibility

## Open Questions

1. What is the phoneme inventory size?
2. Is the script phonetic, logographic, or mixed?
3. If phonetic, is it alphabetic, syllabic, or abugida?
4. Which language family (if any)?
5. Are there prosodic features (tone, stress, length)?
6. What are the syllable structures?
7. How do symbols map to sounds?
