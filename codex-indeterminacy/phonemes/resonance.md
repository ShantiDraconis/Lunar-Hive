# Articulatory Resonance

## Purpose

This document explores articulatory phonetics and resonance patterns that constrain possible phoneme inventories, even without knowing actual pronunciation.

## Status

🔄 **Theoretical framework** - Based on universal articulatory phonetics.

## What Is Articulatory Resonance?

**Articulation:** How speech sounds are produced physically.
**Resonance:** How vocal tract shape creates different sound qualities.

**Key principle:** Human articulatory anatomy constrains possible sounds.

## Universal Articulatory Constraints

### Vocal Tract Anatomy

**All humans share:**
- Lungs (airflow source)
- Larynx (voicing source)
- Pharynx (resonating chamber)
- Oral cavity (primary articulation site)
- Nasal cavity (secondary resonance)

**Implication:** Possible sounds are limited by universal anatomy.

### Impossibility Constraints

**Humans cannot produce:**
- Sounds requiring impossible vocal tract configurations
- Simultaneous articulations at distant points (mostly)
- Sounds violating aerodynamic principles
- Sounds outside human hearing range (as phonemes)

**Relevance:** Proposed phoneme inventories must respect these limits.

## Articulatory Dimensions

### 1. Place of Articulation (Where)

**Consonant places (front to back):**
- **Bilabial:** /p, b, m, w/ (both lips)
- **Labiodental:** /f, v/ (lips + teeth)
- **Dental:** /θ, ð/ (tongue + teeth)
- **Alveolar:** /t, d, n, s, z, l, r/ (tongue + alveolar ridge)
- **Retroflex:** /ṭ, ḍ, ṇ, ṣ/ (tongue curled back) - common in Indic languages
- **Palatal:** /c, ɟ, ɲ, ç, j/ (tongue + hard palate)
- **Velar:** /k, g, ŋ, x/ (tongue + soft palate)
- **Uvular:** /q, ɢ, ʁ/ (tongue + uvula) - less common
- **Pharyngeal:** /ħ, ʕ/ (pharynx constriction) - rare, Semitic
- **Glottal:** /ʔ, h/ (glottis)

**Vowel places:**
- **Front:** /i, e, ɛ/ (tongue front, high to low)
- **Central:** /ɨ, ə, a/ (tongue center)
- **Back:** /u, o, ɔ/ (tongue back, high to low)

**Typological expectation:** Most languages use 3-5 places for stops, 3-5 vowel positions.

### 2. Manner of Articulation (How)

**Consonant manners:**
- **Stop/Plosive:** Complete blockage then release (/p, t, k, b, d, g/)
- **Fricative:** Narrow constriction, turbulent airflow (/f, s, h/)
- **Affricate:** Stop + fricative (/tʃ/ as in "church")
- **Nasal:** Oral blockage, nasal airflow (/m, n, ŋ/)
- **Liquid:** Lateral or central approximation (/l, r/)
- **Glide:** Vowel-like consonants (/w, j/)

**Typological expectation:** Most languages have stops, nasals, and at least one fricative.

**Vowel manners:**
- **Oral:** Air flows through mouth
- **Nasal:** Air flows through nose (nasalized vowels)

### 3. Voicing

**Voiced:** Vocal folds vibrate (/b, d, g, z, v, vowels/)
**Voiceless:** Vocal folds don't vibrate (/p, t, k, s, f/)

**Typological pattern:**
- Most languages contrast voiced and voiceless stops
- Some languages lack voicing contrast (Hawaiian)
- Few languages have voiceless sonorants (nasals, liquids)

### 4. Aspiration

**Aspirated:** Burst of air after release (/pʰ, tʰ, kʰ/)
**Unaspirated:** Minimal air release (/p, t, k/)

**Typological pattern:**
- Common in Indic languages (Sanskrit, Hindi)
- Absent in Romance languages (Spanish, Italian)
- English has aspiration but it's not phonemic

**Relevance:** If Harappan is Dravidian or Indo-Aryan, aspiration may be present.

## Resonance and Vowel Quality

### Formants

**Definition:** Resonance frequencies of vocal tract.
- **F1 (First formant):** Correlates with tongue height (high vowels = low F1)
- **F2 (Second formant):** Correlates with tongue frontness (front vowels = high F2)
- **F3+:** Additional formants for r-coloring, etc.

**Vowel space:** Defined by F1 and F2, creates characteristic vowel triangle/quadrilateral.

**Universal pattern:** Languages maximize perceptual distance between vowels in this space.

### Minimal Vowel Systems

**Three-vowel system /a, i, u/:**
- Maximally distinct in vowel space
- /i/ high front, /u/ high back, /a/ low central
- Found in ~10% of world's languages
- Typologically unmarked

**Five-vowel system /a, e, i, o, u/:**
- Most common system (~40% of languages)
- Adds mid vowels /e, o/
- Balanced distribution in vowel space

**Implication:** If Harappan script marks vowels, expect 3-5 distinct vowels minimum.

## Natural Classes and Patterns

### Natural Sound Classes

Sounds that pattern together phonologically:
- **Obstruents:** Stops and fricatives (can be voiceless)
- **Sonorants:** Nasals, liquids, glides, vowels (usually voiced)
- **Sibilants:** /s, z, ʃ, ʒ/ (high-frequency fricatives)

**Relevance:** Phonological rules apply to natural classes, not arbitrary groups.

### Markedness

**Unmarked (typologically common):**
- Voiceless stops /p, t, k/
- Vowels /a, i, u/
- Nasals /m, n/

**Marked (typologically rare):**
- Ejectives, implosives
- Click consonants
- Pharyngeal consonants
- Tone (common in some regions, absent in others)

**Principle:** Unmarked elements appear in inventories first. Marked elements imply unmarked present.

**Example:** If a language has /g/, it has /k/. Not vice versa necessarily.

## Syllable Structure and Resonance

### Sonority Hierarchy

**Most sonorous (vowel-like) → Least sonorous (consonant-like):**
1. Vowels
2. Glides (/w, j/)
3. Liquids (/l, r/)
4. Nasals (/m, n/)
5. Fricatives (/s, f/)
6. Stops (/p, t, k/)

**Syllable structure principle:** Sonority rises to peak (nucleus) then falls.

**Legal syllables:** /pra/ (p < r < a > 0) ✓
**Illegal syllables:** /arp/ (a > r > p declining twice) ✗ (rare)

**Relevance:** If Harappan is syllabary, expect CV or CVC, not complex clusters violating sonority.

## Articulatory Effort and Frequency

### Economy Principle

**Hypothesis:** Frequent phonemes should be articulatorily simple.

**Evidence:**
- /a/ (most common vowel) is least effortful (neutral tongue position)
- /t, k/ (very common) are simpler than /q, ʡ/ (rare)
- Stops (simple articulation) more common than trills (complex)

**Relevance:** High-frequency symbols in Harappan may map to simple articulations.

### Co-articulation

**Definition:** Articulation of one sound influences the next.

**Example:**
- /k/ before /i/ is fronted (palatal)
- /k/ before /u/ is backed (velar)
- This is automatic, not phonemic

**Relevance:** If script is phonetically detailed, co-articulation may be represented. If phonemic, it's not.

## Cross-Linguistic Resonance Patterns

### Dravidian Phonetics

**Characteristic features:**
- Retroflex consonants (tongue curled back)
- Geminate consonants (doubled: /tt/, /pp/)
- Vowel length distinctions
- Dental vs. alveolar contrasts

**Articulatory basis:** Retroflexion requires specific tongue control, common in Indic area.

### Indo-European Phonetics

**Characteristic features (Sanskrit):**
- Aspiration contrasts
- Complex consonant clusters
- Vocalic /r/ (syllabic consonant)
- Pitch accent (Vedic)

**Articulatory basis:** Aspiration requires precise glottal timing.

## Articulatory Constraints on Script Type

### Alphabetic Script

**Requirement:** Small inventory (~20-40 symbols for phonemes).

**Articulatory basis:** Each symbol = one phoneme. Efficient for languages with moderate phoneme count.

### Syllabary

**Requirement:** Moderate inventory (~60-200 symbols for syllables).

**Articulatory basis:** Each symbol = CV or V syllable. Natural for CV-heavy languages.

**Japanese:** 46 basic kana (5 vowels × 9 consonants + 1 nasal)

### Logographic

**Requirement:** Large inventory (1000s of symbols).

**Articulatory basis:** Symbols represent words/morphemes, not sounds directly.

**Chinese:** ~50,000 characters (3000-4000 for literacy)

**Harappan (~400-700 symbols):** Too many for alphabet, too few for pure logographic.
**Hypothesis:** Syllabary or mixed logographic-phonetic.
**Confidence:** Speculative

## Falsification Criteria

### Would Support Articulatory Model:
- Phoneme inventory matches typological expectations
- Natural classes pattern together in script
- Sonority constraints reflected in symbol combinations
- Articulatorily similar sounds represented by similar symbols

### Would Weaken Model:
- Typologically impossible inventory
- Violations of universal constraints
- Random symbol-sound mappings (if deciphered)

### Would Falsify:
- Proven non-phonetic script
- Decipherment shows entirely different system
- Articulatorily impossible phonemes proposed

## Open Questions

1. What is the articulatory profile of Harappan language(s)?
2. Does retroflexion appear (suggesting Dravidian influence)?
3. Does aspiration appear (suggesting Indo-Aryan influence)?
4. What is vowel inventory size and quality?
5. Are there marked (rare) phonemes suggesting special status?
6. Do symbol combinations respect sonority sequencing?
