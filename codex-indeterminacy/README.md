# 📘 CODEX INDETERMINACY

**Symbolic · Linguistic · Structural Indeterminacy Repository**

Codex Indeterminacy documents symbols, scripts, and phonetic structures as indeterminate systems — mapping possibilities, not asserting translations.

## What This Is

The Codex Indeterminacy is an **atlas of symbolic indeterminacy**, where signs, phonemes, scripts, numbers, and linguistic structures are organized as comparative hypotheses with traceability, alternatives, and falsification criteria.

It translates indeterminacy into readable structure.

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ A definitive dictionary
- ❌ An official translation system
- ❌ A manifesto
- ❌ A theoretical core

## Purpose

This repository serves as the **public symbolic and linguistic interface** of the Ecletic S system:
- Explores symbolic and linguistic indeterminacy with rigor
- Maintains multiple hypotheses and alternatives
- Documents rejected paths and confidence levels
- Maps possibilities without asserting final meanings

## Hierarchical Relationship

```
Universe 0/0 / Indeterminacy
        ↓
ecletics (private, decides)

**The Codex does not decide. It does not consolidate. It explores with rigor.**

## Structure

- **`methodology/`** - Principles, comparison rules, falsifiability criteria, epistemic limits
- **`symbols/`** - Symbol inventory, classification, geometry, numeric symbols
- **`phonemes/`** - Base sound sets, transitions, resonance patterns
- **`scripts/`** - Harappan, proto-scripts, cross-script comparisons, non-linear readings
- **`mappings/`** - Hypotheses, alternatives, rejected paths, confidence levels
- **`comparative_tables/`** - Cross-language, symbol-to-sound, symbol-to-function mappings
- **`indeterminacy_models/`** - Symbolic, linguistic, and numeric indeterminacy models
- **`open_questions/`** - Unresolved symbols, ambiguous structures, paradox cases
- **`media/`** - Video documentation index
