# Confidence Level Criteria

## Purpose

Establishes explicit criteria for assigning confidence levels to hypotheses.

## Confidence Scale

### High Confidence (75-95%)

**Criteria:**
- Multiple independent lines of evidence
- No strong counter-evidence
- Peer-reviewed support
- Falsification criteria passed
- Alternative explanations weaker

**Example domains:**
- Well-established typological patterns
- Secure archaeological contexts
- Replicated statistical findings

**Not equivalent to "proven"** - Still provisional

### Medium Confidence (40-74%)

**Criteria:**
- Some supporting evidence
- Few counter-examples
- Some peer discussion
- Falsification criteria partially tested
- Alternatives exist but are weaker

**Example domains:**
- Plausible structural patterns
- Reasonable comparative parallels
- Statistical trends (not definitive)

**Typical for:** Working hypotheses

### Low Confidence (10-39%)

**Criteria:**
- Minimal evidence
- Significant counter-evidence possible
- Little peer validation
- Falsification criteria not fully tested
- Strong alternatives remain

**Example domains:**
- Early-stage hypotheses
- Speculative connections
- Preliminary pattern observations

**Typical for:** Exploratory ideas

### Very Low / Speculative (<10%)

**Criteria:**
- Very little evidence
- Possibly untestable currently
- No peer validation
- Many alternatives equally viable
- Exploratory only

**Example domains:**
- Initial hunches
- Analogical thinking
- Creative speculation

**Typical for:** Brainstorming, not analysis

## Confidence Adjustment

### Increase Confidence When:
- New evidence supports hypothesis
- Alternative explanations excluded
- Independent replication
- Peer validation
- Falsification tests passed

### Decrease Confidence When:
- Counter-evidence emerges
- Alternative explanation strengthens
- Replication fails
- Peer criticism
- Falsification criteria suggest weakness

### Reject When:
- Definitively falsified
- Methodological flaw identified
- Better alternative clearly superior

## Domain-Specific Confidence

Different domains have different confidence ceilings:

**Phonetic values (Harappan):** Ceiling ~30% (no bilingual)
**Structural patterns:** Ceiling ~70% (statistical evidence possible)
**Language affiliation:** Ceiling ~50% (comparative evidence limited)
**Symbol function:** Ceiling ~60% (distributional evidence available)

**Reason:** Cannot exceed evidence quality limits.

## Transparency Requirement

**Always state confidence level explicitly:**
- In hypothesis statements
- In comparative claims
- In interpretations

**Never:**
- Present low-confidence claim as fact
- Omit confidence assessment
- Use vague language without quantification

*Confidence levels maintain epistemic humility.*
