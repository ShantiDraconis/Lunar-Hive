# Rejected Paths

## Purpose

Documents hypotheses that have been tested and rejected, with rationale for rejection.

## Why Document Rejections?

1. **Prevents repetition** - Don't test same failed hypothesis again
2. **Shows rigor** - Demonstrates hypothesis testing
3. **Guides future work** - Failed paths inform successful ones
4. **Educational value** - Learn from mistakes

## Rejection Criteria

Hypothesis rejected when:
- Definitively falsified by evidence
- Better alternative explains evidence more parsimoniously
- Methodological flaw identified that cannot be corrected
- Violates established constraints (typological, articulatory, etc.)

## Currently Rejected Hypotheses

### Example Format

**Hypothesis:** [Statement]
**Proposed by:** [Source/researcher]
**Date proposed:** [When]
**Evidence presented:** [What supported it]
**Reason for rejection:** [Why rejected]
**Date rejected:** [When]
**Alternative adopted:** [What replaced it, if any]

## Partially Rejected Approaches

Some approaches not wholly rejected but significantly weakened or limited.

### Example: Pure Pictographic Reading

**Hypothesis:** Harappan symbols can be read as direct pictures of objects.
**Status:** Partially rejected
**Reason:** Some symbols may be pictographic, but system appears more complex.
**Retained element:** Pictographic component in mixed system possible.

## Methodologically Flawed Approaches

Some proposals rejected due to methodological issues rather than empirical falsification.

**Examples:**
- Cherry-picking evidence
- Circular reasoning
- Ignoring counter-evidence
- Unfalsifiable claims

**Treatment:** Note flaw, document why rejected on methodological grounds.

## Revived Hypotheses

Sometimes rejected hypotheses are reconsidered with:
- New evidence
- Better methodology
- Corrected errors

**Process:** Document original rejection, new evidence, and rationale for reconsideration.
