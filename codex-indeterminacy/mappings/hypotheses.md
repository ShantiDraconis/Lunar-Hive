# Mapping Hypotheses

## Purpose

Documents current hypotheses for symbol-to-meaning, symbol-to-sound, and structural mappings with explicit confidence levels and falsification criteria.

## Status

🔄 **Highly tentative** - All mappings are provisional hypotheses.

## Hypothesis Framework

Each hypothesis must include:
- **Statement:** Clear claim
- **Supporting evidence:** What supports this
- **Alternatives:** Other possible interpretations
- **Falsification criteria:** What would disprove it
- **Confidence level:** Low/Medium/High

See `methodology/falsifiability.md` for detailed framework.

## Symbol-to-Function Hypotheses

### Positional Markers

**Hypothesis 1.1:** Certain symbols function as initial determinatives.

**Evidence:**
- Symbols appearing predominantly in initial position
- Statistical significance of positional distribution

**Alternatives:**
- Common initial words (linguistic not grammatical)
- Names or titles always appearing first

**Falsification:** Finding these symbols frequently in non-initial positions in larger corpus.

**Confidence:** Low-Medium

### Grammatical Markers

**Hypothesis 2.1:** Final position symbols may be grammatical suffixes.

**Evidence:**
- Positional regularity
- Typological pattern in agglutinative languages

**Alternatives:**
- Final honorifics or titles
- Phonetic not grammatical

**Falsification:** Decipherment showing non-grammatical function.

**Confidence:** Low

## Symbol-to-Sound Hypotheses

### Phonetic Values (Highly Speculative)

**Note:** Without bilingual or phonetic indicators, all phonetic hypotheses are extremely speculative.

**General principle:** Only propose phonetic values with:
- Comparative linguistic evidence
- Multiple independent supporting arguments
- Explicit low confidence markers

**Current status:** No widely accepted phonetic values for Harappan symbols.

**Confidence:** Very low for any specific phonetic hypothesis.

## Structural Hypotheses

### Text Structure

**Hypothesis 3.1:** Seal texts follow pattern: [Determinative] [Name] [Title/Affiliation]

**Evidence:**
- Three-part structure common in short inscriptions
- Positional regularities
- Functional expectation for seals

**Alternatives:**
- [Commodity] [Quantity] [Source]
- [Subject] [Verb] [Object]
- Single compound word

**Falsification:** Longer texts showing different structure, or decipherment revealing different pattern.

**Confidence:** Low

## Numeric Hypotheses

See `symbols/numeric_symbols.md` for detailed discussion.

**Hypothesis 4.1:** Stroke repetitions (||||) represent tally marks.

**Evidence:**
- Common pattern in early writing
- 1-7 strokes observed (natural counting range)

**Alternatives:**
- Not numerals at all
- Phonetic not numeric

**Falsification:** Finding stroke patterns inconsistent with counting, or decipherment showing non-numeric function.

**Confidence:** Medium (common pattern but unproven)

## Language Affiliation Hypotheses

### Dravidian Hypothesis

**Hypothesis 5.1:** Harappan script represents a Dravidian language.

**Evidence:**
- Geographic presence of Dravidian languages
- Some vocabulary correspondences proposed
- Structural parallels suggested

**Alternatives:**
- Indo-Aryan
- Austro-Asiatic (Munda)
- Language isolate
- Multiple languages

**Falsification:** Definitive evidence of different language family, or strong counter-evidence.

**Confidence:** Low (one of several competing hypotheses)

## Working Hypotheses vs. Speculative Ideas

### Working Hypotheses
- Have some evidential support
- Used as framework for analysis
- Regularly tested and revised
- May be elevated or rejected

### Speculative Ideas
- Minimal evidence
- Exploratory only
- Not used as analytical framework
- Documented for completeness

**Current practice:** Treat all Harappan hypotheses as tentative, most as speculative.

## Hypothesis Tracking

### Revision History

Hypotheses evolve. Track:
- Original formulation
- Revisions based on new evidence
- Confidence level changes
- Reasons for changes

**Principle:** Never delete rejected hypotheses—document why rejected.

## Comparison with Other Undeciphered Scripts

**Lesson from Proto-Elamite, Linear A, etc.:**
- Multiple competing hypotheses persist for decades
- Some hypotheses eventually proven wrong
- Some remain unresolvable

**Harappan:** Similar situation. Multiple hypotheses, no consensus.

## Open Research Questions

1. What would constitute strong evidence for a mapping hypothesis?
2. How can we test hypotheses without decipherment?
3. What confidence level is appropriate for different types of claims?
4. When should a hypothesis be elevated or rejected?

*All mappings are provisional. Expect revision or rejection.*

**Status:** Framework established. Specific hypotheses require detailed separate documentation.
