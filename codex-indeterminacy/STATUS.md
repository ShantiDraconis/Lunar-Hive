# Status

## Current State

**Exploratory · Comparative · Non-final**

## Repository Status

This repository is in **active exploration** mode. All content represents:
- Working hypotheses
- Preliminary comparisons
- Tentative mappings
- Open-ended questions

## What This Status Means

### For Researchers
- Content is **not peer-reviewed** in traditional academic sense
- Multiple hypotheses are maintained simultaneously
- Confidence levels are explicitly marked
- Falsification criteria are documented

### For General Readers
- Nothing here is "decoded" or "solved"
- Symbols and sounds are **possibilities**, not certainties
- Alternative interpretations are always present
- Questions remain deliberately open

### For Contributors
- All additions must maintain epistemic humility
- Multiple alternatives must be documented
- Rejected paths must be explained, not deleted
- Confidence levels must be explicit

## Confidence Level System

When content includes hypotheses, they are marked with:

- **High Confidence** - Strong comparative evidence, multiple independent sources
- **Medium Confidence** - Reasonable evidence, some independent support
- **Low Confidence** - Speculative, requires more evidence
- **Experimental** - Exploratory, very preliminary

## Protection Statement

This status protects the repository academically and legally by:
- Not claiming definitive decipherment
- Maintaining epistemic boundaries
- Documenting uncertainty explicitly
- Allowing exploration without false authority

## Evolution

As hypotheses mature and stabilize, they may be:
1. Elevated in confidence level (with justification)
2. Archived in the canonical Lunar-Hive repository
3. Rejected and documented in `rejected_paths.md`
4. Split into multiple competing alternatives

## Stability Markers

Individual files may include stability indicators:
- 🔄 **Highly volatile** - Actively changing, multiple revisions expected
- 📋 **Under review** - Stabilizing, awaiting validation
- ✓ **Relatively stable** - Core structure established, refinements only
- 📦 **Archived** - Moved to canonical repository, maintained here for reference

## Academic Disclaimer

**This repository does not claim:**
- To have deciphered any undeciphered script
- To provide definitive translations
- To supersede academic consensus
- To offer final historical truth

**This repository does claim:**
- To explore symbolic indeterminacy rigorously
- To maintain multiple hypotheses transparently
- To document process and alternatives
- To operate within epistemic limits

## Review Cycle

Content undergoes continuous review:
- Internal coordination via ecletics
- Community feedback and discussion
- Academic consultation where appropriate
- Falsification testing against new evidence
