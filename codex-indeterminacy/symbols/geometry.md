# Geometric Analysis of Symbols

## Purpose

This document analyzes symbols through pure geometric properties, independent of representational or semantic content.

## Why Geometry?

Geometric analysis is the most objective level of symbol study because:
- Measurable properties
- Culture-independent
- Falsifiable
- Foundation for further analysis

## Geometric Properties

### Basic Elements

#### Lines
**Types:**
- Vertical lines
- Horizontal lines
- Diagonal lines (various angles)
- Curved lines (arcs, circles)

**Measurements:**
- Length (absolute and relative)
- Angle of orientation
- Curvature (for curved lines)
- Thickness/weight

**Frequency:** Very high (fundamental building blocks)

#### Closed Shapes
**Types:**
- Circles and ovals
- Squares and rectangles
- Triangles
- Polygons (5+ sides)
- Irregular closed forms

**Measurements:**
- Area (absolute and relative)
- Perimeter
- Aspect ratio
- Regularity/irregularity

**Frequency:** High (common in both abstract and pictographic symbols)

#### Compound Forms
**Types:**
- Enclosed elements (shapes within shapes)
- Touching elements (connected shapes)
- Overlapping elements
- Adjacent elements (separate but grouped)

**Complexity levels:**
- 2 elements (bigrams)
- 3-5 elements (moderate compounds)
- 6+ elements (complex compounds)

### Symmetry Analysis

#### Reflection Symmetry

**Vertical axis:**
- Count: ~X% of corpus (estimate pending full analysis)
- Examples: [specific symbols]
- Hypothesis: May correlate with semantic categories?
- Confidence: Low

**Horizontal axis:**
- Count: ~Y% of corpus
- Examples: [specific symbols]
- Less common than vertical
- Confidence: Low

**Diagonal axes:**
- Rare in Harappan corpus
- May indicate borrowing or specialized symbols
- Confidence: Very low

#### Rotational Symmetry

**180° rotation:**
- Some symbols invariant under half-rotation
- Examples: certain cross forms, radial patterns
- Analytical interest: Writing direction independence?

**90° rotation:**
- Rare
- Four-fold symmetry symbols
- Examples: some star/stellar patterns

**Other rotations:**
- Very rare
- May be coincidental or artifact

### Proportions and Ratios

#### Aspect Ratio
- Width to height ratio
- Clusters around certain values?
- Statistical analysis pending

**Hypothesis:** Standard aspect ratios may indicate:
- Scribal conventions
- Material constraints (seal size)
- Aesthetic preferences

**Confidence:** Low (requires measurement)

#### Element Ratios
- Relative sizes of components in compound symbols
- Do components maintain fixed proportions?
- Statistical analysis pending

### Spatial Organization

#### Bounding Box
- Minimum rectangle containing symbol
- Relative to other symbols
- Inscription space usage

#### Internal Structure
**Patterns:**
- Top-bottom organization
- Left-right organization
- Center-periphery organization
- Radial organization

**Examples:**
- Some symbols have clear top/bottom distinction
- Others show internal subdivision
- Some have focal points or centers

### Topological Properties

#### Connectivity
- Number of separate components
- Are elements connected or disconnected?
- Holes (topological genus)

**Examples:**
- Symbol with one hole (like "O")
- Symbol with two holes (like "8")
- Multiple disconnected parts

**Analytical value:** Topological invariants may be significant for classification.

#### Enclosure
- Does symbol enclose space?
- Are elements nested?
- Multiple levels of enclosure?

**Hypothesis:** Enclosure may correlate with:
- Semantic containment?
- Grammatical function?
- Stylistic convention?

**Confidence:** Speculative

### Stroke Properties (Reconstructed)

**Note:** For carved symbols (seals), stroke order is not directly observable but can be hypothesized.

#### Estimated Stroke Count
- Minimum strokes to create symbol
- Assumes efficient scribal practice
- Actual practice may vary

**Hypothesis:** Stroke economy may correlate with:
- Frequency (common symbols kept simple)
- Historical evolution (simplification over time)

**Confidence:** Low-Medium

#### Stroke Complexity
- Simple strokes (single lines/curves)
- Complex strokes (compound curves)
- Connection points between strokes

### Angular Analysis

#### Angle Measurements
- Internal angles within symbols
- Orientation angles relative to baseline

**Observations (pending systematic analysis):**
- Certain angles appear frequently
- Right angles (90°) common
- Oblique angles show clustering?

**Hypothesis:** Standard angles may indicate:
- Scribal tools/techniques
- Aesthetic conventions
- Geometric constraints

### Scale and Size

#### Absolute Size
- Physical dimensions of symbols on seals
- Variation within and across inscriptions

#### Relative Size
- Size compared to other symbols in same text
- Hierarchical sizing?
- Uniform sizing?

**Observations:**
- Most Harappan symbols similar size (within inscription)
- Occasional outliers (larger/smaller)

**Hypothesis:** Size variation may indicate:
- Emphasis
- Different functional categories
- Artistic liberty

**Confidence:** Low

## Geometric Clustering

### Similarity Metrics

Can symbols be clustered by geometric similarity?

**Distance measures:**
- Shape difference (area, perimeter, compactness)
- Symmetry similarity
- Complexity distance
- Angular similarity

**Method:** Computational geometry + clustering algorithms

**Status:** Preliminary - requires systematic measurement

**Potential outcome:** Natural groupings may reveal:
- Historical evolution paths
- Functional categories
- Borrowing or convergence

## Cross-Script Geometric Comparison

### Universal Geometric Forms

Many scripts use similar basic elements:
- Vertical/horizontal lines (universal)
- Circles (very common)
- Triangles (common)
- Crosses (common)

**Caution:** Geometric similarity does not imply historical connection. These are fundamental human drawing patterns.

### Distinctive Geometric Features

Which geometric properties are distinctive to Harappan?
- Specific compound patterns?
- Unusual angles or proportions?
- Characteristic asymmetries?

**Analysis pending:** Requires comparative geometric database.

## Statistical Geometry

### Distributions

Can we characterize the corpus by:
- Distribution of symmetry types
- Distribution of complexity levels
- Distribution of aspect ratios
- Distribution of element counts

**Goal:** Quantitative profile of geometric properties

**Status:** Requires systematic measurement across corpus

### Outliers

- Symbols with unusual geometric properties
- May indicate: errors, foreign symbols, rare categories, or special meanings

**Method:** Statistical outlier detection based on geometric metrics

## Geometric Evolution

### Diachronic Analysis (if temporal stratification available)

Do geometric properties change over time?
- Simplification trends?
- Elaboration trends?
- Standardization vs. variation?

**Status:** Requires temporal stratification of corpus (limited availability)

## Measurement Challenges

### Limitations

1. **Preservation** - degraded symbols difficult to measure
2. **Variability** - scribal variation vs. meaningful difference
3. **Material** - impression quality varies
4. **Scale** - measurement precision limits
5. **Subjectivity** - where exactly to place boundaries

### Standards

For reproducibility, establish:
- Measurement protocols
- Digital tracing standards
- Inter-rater reliability
- Error margins

## Applications

Geometric analysis supports:
- Objective symbol classification
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Cross-script comparison
- Forgery detection (anachronistic geometry)
- Scribal hand identification

## Future Work

- Complete geometric measurement of corpus
- Statistical analysis of distributions
- Clustering analysis
- Cross-script geometric database
- Computational geometric analysis tools
