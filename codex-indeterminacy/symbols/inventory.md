# Symbol Inventory

## Purpose

This document provides a non-semantic inventory of symbols found in analyzed scripts, focusing on observable properties rather than interpretations.

## Methodology

Symbols are catalogued based on:
- **Form** - geometric and structural properties
- **Frequency** - occurrence in available corpus
- **Position** - where they appear (initial, medial, final, isolated)
- **Combinations** - which symbols appear together
- **Variants** - documented variations in form

**Not included:** Semantic meanings, phonetic values, or definitive translations.

## Status

🔄 **Highly volatile** - Active documentation in progress

This inventory grows as new inscriptions are analyzed and refined as patterns emerge.

## Harappan/Indus Valley Script

### Preliminary Count
- Estimated symbol count: ~400-700 distinct signs
- Well-attested symbols: ~100-150
- Hapax legomena (single occurrence): ~60-70%
- Sample corpus: ~4000 inscriptions (primarily seals)

### Classification by Form

**Note:** Classifications are structural, not semantic.

#### Geometric Basic Forms
- Linear elements (straight lines, simple angles)
- Circular/curved elements
- Compound geometric (combinations of basic shapes)

#### Complex Pictographic Forms
- Anthropomorphic elements
- Zoomorphic elements
- Botanical elements
- Object representations
- Abstract symbols

#### Positional Markers (hypothesis)
- Symbols appearing consistently at text beginnings
- Symbols appearing consistently at text endings
- Symbols appearing in medial positions only
- Isolated symbols (single-symbol inscriptions)

### Frequency Tiers (Preliminary)

**Tier 1 (Very High Frequency)**
- Top 10 most frequent symbols
- Account for ~40-50% of all symbol occurrences
- Hypothesis: Possibly phonetic or functional markers

**Tier 2 (High Frequency)**
- Next 20-30 symbols
- Account for ~25-30% of occurrences
- Hypothesis: Core vocabulary or common phonemes

**Tier 3 (Medium Frequency)**
- Next 50-70 symbols
- Account for ~15-20% of occurrences
- Hypothesis: Mix of semantic and phonetic elements

**Tier 4 (Low Frequency)**
- Remaining symbols
- Account for ~5-10% of occurrences
- Include many unique or rare signs

### Combination Patterns

**Observed (not interpreted):**
- Some symbols appear almost exclusively in specific sequences
- Some symbols never appear together
- Some positions show restricted symbol sets
- Some symbols appear in multiple positions, others position-specific

**Hypothesis status:** Low confidence - requires statistical validation.

## Proto-Sumerian / Early Cuneiform

### Preliminary Count
- Estimated early sign count: ~1200+ signs (reducing over time)
- Well-documented evolution to standardized cuneiform
- Partially deciphered (advantage for comparison)

### Relevance for Comparison
- Similar time period (overlap possible)
- Known evolution from pictographic to abstract
- Documented semantic and phonetic values (for some signs)
- Can model how symbolic systems evolve

**Caution:** Different language, different culture—parallels may be typological, not historical.

## Proto-Egyptian (Early Hieroglyphic)

### Preliminary Count
- Early hieroglyphic corpus: several hundred signs
- Well-documented evolution
- Partially deciphered early forms

### Relevance for Comparison
- Similar transition from pictographic to standardized
- Mixed system (logographic + phonetic) well-documented
- Geographic proximity to some trade routes
- Can model pictographic interpretation strategies

**Caution:** Writing direction and structure differ significantly from Harappan.

## Runic Systems

### Multiple Traditions
- Elder Futhark (24 runes)
- Younger Futhark (16 runes)
- Anglo-Saxon futhorc (28-33 runes)

### Relevance for Comparison
- Small symbol inventories (manageable comparison)
- Known phonetic values
- Mix of phonetic and symbolic meaning
- Evolution documented

**Caution:** Much later time period, different geographic and cultural context.

## Symbol Properties for Analysis

### Geometric Analysis

For each symbol, document:
1. **Basic shape** - circle, line, angle, curve, compound
2. **Symmetry** - vertical, horizontal, rotational, none
3. **Complexity** - number of strokes or elements
4. **Orientation** - fixed or variable
5. **Size** - relative to other symbols
6. **Variants** - documented variations in form

### Distributional Analysis

For each symbol, track:
1. **Total frequency** - occurrences in corpus
2. **Text frequency** - in how many different inscriptions
3. **Position distribution** - initial/medial/final/isolated
4. **Context** - seal/pottery/other material
5. **Geographic distribution** - if known
6. **Temporal distribution** - if stratification exists

### Combinatorial Analysis

For each symbol, analyze:
1. **Preceding symbols** - what appears before
2. **Following symbols** - what appears after
3. **Never-combinations** - what never co-occurs
4. **Frequent pairs** - common bigrams/trigrams
5. **Isolation rate** - how often appears alone

## Data Collection Standards

### Minimum Documentation

Each symbol entry should include:
```
Symbol ID: [Unique identifier]
Form description: [Geometric/pictographic description]
Frequency: [Count in corpus of N inscriptions]
Position distribution: [Initial: X%, Medial: Y%, Final: Z%, Isolated: W%]
Common combinations: [List of frequent co-occurrences]
Variants: [Documented variations]
Material contexts: [Where found: seals, pottery, etc.]
Confidence in classification: [High/Medium/Low]
Notes: [Additional observations]
```

### Quality Markers

- ✓ **High confidence** - symbol well-attested, clear form, consistent usage
- ~ **Medium confidence** - some variation, moderate frequency
- ? **Low confidence** - rare, degraded, or ambiguous form
- ! **Disputed** - conflicting classifications in literature

## Cross-Script Symbol Comparison

**Future work:** Systematic comparison of:
- Visual form similarities
- Positional pattern similarities
- Frequency distribution similarities
- Combinatorial pattern similarities

**Methodology:** See `methodology/comparison_rules.md`

## Updates and Revisions

This inventory is continuously updated as:
- New inscriptions are discovered
- Analysis methods improve
- Statistical tools are applied
- Patterns emerge or are falsified

**Version tracking:** Document major revisions with rationale.

## Limitations

This inventory is limited by:
- Incomplete corpus (many inscriptions not yet analyzed)
- Preservation biases (durable materials over-represented)
- Classification ambiguity (some symbols hard to distinguish)
- Current understanding (may require reclassification)

**Acknowledge these limits explicitly in all analysis.**

*This is a working inventory, not a definitive catalog.*

**Status:** Preliminary framework established. Detailed symbol-by-symbol documentation in progress.
